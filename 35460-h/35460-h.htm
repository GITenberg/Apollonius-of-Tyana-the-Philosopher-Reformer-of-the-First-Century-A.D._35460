<h2>APOLLONIUS OF TYANA.</h2>

<hr />

<h4><span class="smcap">Section I.</span></h4>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY.</h3>

<p>To the student of the origins of Christianity
there is naturally no period of Western history
of greater interest and importance than the first
century of our era; and yet how little comparatively
is known about it of a really definite and
reliable nature. If it be a subject of lasting
regret that no non-Christian writer of the first
century had sufficient intuition of the future to
record even a line of information concerning the
birth and growth of what was to be the religion
of the Western world, equally disappointing is
it to find so little definite information of the
general social and religious conditions of the
time. The rulers and the wars of the Empire
seem to have formed the chief interest of the
historiographers of the succeeding century, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>even in this department of political history, though
the public acts of the Emperors may be fairly
well known, for we can check them by records
and inscriptions, when we come to their private
acts and motives we find ourselves no longer on
the ground of history, but for the most part in the
atmosphere of prejudice, scandal, and speculation.
The political acts of Emperors and their officers,
however, can at best throw but a dim side-light
on the general social conditions of the time, while
they shed no light at all on the religious conditions,
except so far as these in any particular
contacted the domain of politics. As well might
we seek to reconstruct a picture of the religious
life of the time from Imperial acts and rescripts,
as endeavour to glean any idea of the intimate
religion of this country from a perusal of statute
books or reports of Parliamentary debates.</p>

<p>The Roman histories so-called, to which we
have so far been accustomed, cannot help us in
the reconstruction of a picture of the environment
into which, on the one hand, Paul led the
new faith in Asia Minor, Greece, and Rome; and
in which, on the other, it already found itself in
the districts bordering on the south-east of the
Mediterranean. It is only by piecing together
laboriously isolated scraps of information and
fragments of inscriptions, that we become aware of
the existence of the life of a world of religious
associations and private cults which existed at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
this period. Not that even so we have any
very direct information of what went on in these
associations, guilds, and brotherhoods; but we
have sufficient evidence to make us keenly regret
the absence of further knowledge.</p>

<p>Difficult as this field is to till, it is exceedingly
fertile in interest, and it is to be regretted that
comparatively so little work has as yet been done
in it; and that, as is so frequently the case, the
work which has been done is, for the most part,
not accessible to the English reader. What work
has been done on this special subject may be
seen from the bibliographical note appended to
this essay, in which is given a list of books and
articles treating of the religious associations
among the Greeks and Romans. But if we seek
to obtain a general view of the condition of
religious affairs in the first century we find ourselves
without a reliable guide; for of works
dealing with this particular subject there are
few, and from them we learn little that does
not immediately concern, or is thought to concern,
Christianity; whereas, it is just the state of the
non-Christian religious world about which, in
the present case, we desire to be informed.</p>

<p>If, for instance, the reader turn to works of
general history, such as Merivale&#8217;s History of the
Romans under the Empire (London; last ed. 1865),
he will find, it is true, in chap. iv., a description<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
of the state of religion up to the death of Nero,
but he will be little wiser for perusing it. If
he turn to Hermann Schiller&#8217;s Geschichte der
r&ouml;mischen Kaiserreichs unter der Regierung des
Nero (Berlin; 1872), he will find much reason
for discarding the vulgar opinions about the
monstrous crimes imputed to Nero, as indeed he
might do by reading in English G. H. Lewes&#8217;
article &#8220;Was Nero a Monster?&#8221; (Cornhill Magazine;
July, 1863)&mdash;and he will also find (bk.
IV. chap. iii.) a general view of the religion and
philosophy of the time which is far more intelligent
than that of Merivale&#8217;s; but all is still very
vague and unsatisfactory, and we feel ourselves
still outside the intimate life of the philosophers
and religionists of the first century.</p>

<p>If, again, he turn to the latest writers of Church
history who have treated this particular question,
he will find that they are occupied entirely with
the contact of the Christian Church with the
Roman Empire, and only incidentally give us
any information of the nature of which we are
in search. On this special ground C. J. Neumann,
in his careful study Der r&ouml;mische Staat und die
allgemeine Kirche bis auf Diocletian (Leipzig;
1890), is interesting; while Prof. W. M. Ramsay,
in The Church in the Roman Empire before <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
170 (London; 1893), is extraordinary, for he
endeavours to interpret Roman history by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
New Testament documents, the dates of the
majority of which are so hotly disputed.</p>

<p>But, you may say, what has all this to do
with Apollonius of Tyana? The answer is
simple: Apollonius lived in the first century;
his work lay precisely among these religious
associations, colleges, and guilds. A knowledge
of them and their nature would give us the
natural environment of a great part of his life;
and information as to their condition in the first
century would perhaps help us the better to
understand some of the reasons for the task
which he attempted.</p>

<p>If, however, it were only the life and
endeavours of Apollonius which would be illuminated
by this knowledge, we could understand
why so little effort has been spent in this
direction; for the character of the Tyanean, as
we shall see, has since the fourth century been
regarded with little favour even by the few,
while the many have been taught to look upon
our philosopher not only as a charlatan, but even
as an anti-Christ. But when it is just a knowledge
of these religious associations and orders
which would throw a flood of light on the earliest
evolution of Christianity, not only with regard
to the Pauline communities, but also with regard
to those schools which were subsequently condemned
as heretical, it is astonishing that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
have had no more satisfactory work done on the
subject.</p>

<p>It may be said, however, that this information
is not forthcoming simply because it is unprocurable.
To a large extent this is true; nevertheless,
a great deal more could be done than has
as yet been attempted, and the results of research
in special directions and in the byways of history
could be combined, so that the non-specialist
could obtain some general idea of the religious
conditions of the times, and so be less inclined
to join in the now stereotyped condemnation
of all non-Jewish or non-Christian moral and
religious effort in the Roman Empire of the
first century.</p>

<p>But the reader may retort: Things social and
religious in those days must have been in a very
parlous state, for, as this essay shows, Apollonius
himself spent the major part of his life in
trying to reform the institutions and cults of the
Empire. To this we answer: No doubt there
was much to reform, and when is there not?
But it would not only be not generous, but
distinctly mischievous for us to judge our fellows
of those days solely by the lofty standard of an
ideal morality, or even to scale them against the
weight of our own supposed virtues and knowledge.
Our point is not that there was nothing
to reform, far from that, but that the wholesale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
accusations of depravity brought against the
times will not bear impartial investigation. On
the contrary, there was much good material
ready to be worked up in many ways, and if
there had not been, how could there among other
things have been any Christianity?</p>

<p>The Roman Empire was at the zenith of its
power, and had there not been many admirable
administrators and men of worth in the governing
caste, such a political consummation could never
have been reached and maintained. Moreover,
as ever previously in the ancient world, religious
liberty was guaranteed, and where we find persecution,
as in the reigns of Nero and Domitian,
it must be set down to political and not to
theological reasons. Setting aside the disputed
question of the persecution of the Christians
under Domitian, the Neronian persecution was
directed against those whom the Imperial power
regarded as Jewish political revolutionaries.
So, too, when we find the philosophers imprisoned
or banished from Rome during these two reigns,
it was not because they were philosophers, but
because the ideal of some of them was the
restoration of the Republic, and this rendered
them obnoxious to the charge not only of being
political malcontents, but also of actively plotting
against the Emperor&#8217;s <i>majestas</i>. Apollonius,
however, was throughout a warm supporter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
monarchical rule. When, then, we hear of the
philosophers being banished from Rome or being
cast into prison, we must remember that this
was not a wholesale persecution of philosophy
throughout the Empire; and when we say that
some of them desired to restore the Republic, we
should remember that the vast majority of them
refrained from politics, and especially was this
the case with the disciples of the religio-philosophical
schools.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section II.</span></h4>

<h3>THE RELIGIOUS ASSOCIATIONS AND
COMMUNITIES OF THE FIRST
CENTURY.</h3>

<p>In the domain of religion it is quite true that
the state cults and national institutions
throughout the Empire were almost without
exception in a parlous state, and it is to
be noticed that Apollonius devoted much time
and labour to reviving and purifying them.
Indeed, their strength had long left the general
state-institutions of religion, where all was now
perfunctory; but so far from there being no
religious life in the land, in proportion as the
official cultus and ancestral institutions afforded
no real satisfaction to their religious needs, the
more earnestly did the people devote themselves
to private cults, and eagerly baptised themselves
in all that flood of religious enthusiasm which
flowed in with ever increasing volume from the
East. Indubitably in all this fermentation there
were many excesses, according to our present
notions of religious decorum, and also grievous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
abuses; but at the same time in it many found
due satisfaction for their religious emotions, and,
if we except those cults which were distinctly
vicious, we have to a large extent before us in
popular circles the spectacle of what, in their
last analysis, are similar phenomena to those
enthusiasms which in our own day may be
frequently witnessed among such sects as the
Shakers or Ranters, and at the general revival
meetings of the uninstructed.</p>

<p>It is not, however, to be thought that the
private cults and the doings of the religious associations
were all of this nature or confined to this
class; far from it. There were religious brotherhoods,
communities, and clubs&mdash;<i>thiasi</i>, <i>erani</i>,
and <i>orge&#333;nes</i>&mdash;of all sorts and conditions. There
were also mutual benefit societies, burial clubs,
and dining companies, the prototypes of our
present-day Masonic bodies, Oddfellows, and
the rest. These religious associations were not
only private in the sense that they were not
maintained by the State, but also for the most
part they were private in the sense that what
they did was kept secret, and this is perhaps
the main reason why we have so defective a
record of them.</p>

<p>Among them are to be numbered not only
the lower forms of mystery-cultus of various
kinds, but also the greater ones, such as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Phrygian, Bacchic, Isiac, and Mithriac Mysteries,
which were spread everywhere throughout the
Empire. The famous Eleusinia were, however,
still under the &aelig;gis of the State, but though so
famous were, as a state-cultus, far more perfunctory.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, not to be thought that the
great types of mystery-cultus above mentioned
were uniform even among themselves. There
were not only various degrees and grades within
them, but also in all probability many forms of
each line of tradition, good, bad, and indifferent.
For instance, we know that it was considered <i>de
rigueur</i> for every respectable citizen of Athens
to be initiated into the Eleusinia, and therefore
the tests could not have been very stringent;
whereas in the most recent work on the
subject, De Apuleio Isiacorum Mysteriorum
Teste (Leyden; 1900), Dr. K. H. E. De Jong
shows that in one form of the Isiac Mysteries
the candidate was invited to initiation by means
of dream; that is to say, he had to be psychically
impressionable before his acceptance.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have a vast intermediate
ground for religious exercise between the most
popular and undisciplined forms of private cults
and the highest forms, which could only be
approached through the discipline and training
of the philosophic life. The higher side of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
mystery-institutions aroused the enthusiasm of
all that was best in antiquity, and unstinted
praise was given to one or another form of them
by the greatest thinkers and writers of Greece
and Rome; so that we cannot but think that
here the instructed found that satisfaction for
their religious needs which was necessary not
only for those who could not rise into the keen
air of pure reason, but also for those who had
climbed so high upon the heights of reason that
they could catch a glimpse of the other side.
The official cults were notoriously unable to give
them this satisfaction, and were only tolerated
by the instructed as an aid for the people and a
means of preserving the traditional life of the
city or state.</p>

<p>By common consent the most virtuous livers
of Greece were the members of the Pythagorean
schools, both men and women. After the death
of their founder the Pythagoreans seem to have
gradually blended with the Orphic communities,
and the &#8220;Orphic life&#8221; was the recognised term
for a life of purity and self-denial. We also
know that the Orphics, and therefore the Pythagoreans,
were actively engaged in the reformation,
or even the entire reforming, of the Baccho-Eleusinian
rites; they seem to have brought
back the pure side of the Bacchic cult with their
reinstitution or reimportation of the Iacchic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
mysteries, and it is very evident that such stern
livers and deep thinkers could not have been
contented with a low form of cult. Their influence
also spread far and wide in general
Bacchic circles, so that we find Euripides putting
the following words into the mouth of a chorus
of Bacchic initiates: &#8220;Clad in white robes I
speed me from the genesis of mortal men, and
never more approach the vase of death, for I
have done with eating food that ever housed a
soul.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Such words could well be put into the
mouth of a Br&#257;hman or Buddhist ascetic, eager
to escape from the bonds of Sa&#7747;s&#257;ra; and such
men cannot therefore justly be classed together
indiscriminately with ribald revellers&mdash;the general
mind-picture of a Bacchic company.</p>

<p>But, some one may say, Euripides and the
Pythagoreans and Orphics are no evidence for
the first century; whatever good there may
have been in such schools and communities, it
had ceased long before. On the contrary, the
evidence is all against this objection. Philo,
writing about 25 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, tells us that in his day
numerous groups of men, who in all respects led
this life of religion, who abandoned their property,
retired from the world and devoted themselves
entirely to the search for wisdom and the culti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>vation
of virtue, were scattered far and wide
throughout the world. In his treatise, On the Contemplative
Life, he writes: &#8220;This natural class
of men is to be found in many parts of the
inhabited world, both the Grecian and non-Grecian
world, sharing in the perfect good.
In Egypt there are crowds of them in every
province, or nome as they call it, and especially
round Alexandria.&#8221; This is a most important
statement, for if there were so many devoted to
the religious life at this time, it follows that the
age was not one of unmixed depravity.</p>

<p>It is not, however, to be thought that these
communities were all of an exactly similar
nature, or of one and the same origin, least of
all that they were all Therapeut or Essene. We
have only to remember the various lines of
descent of the doctrines held by the innumerable
schools classed together as Gnostic, as sketched
in my recent work, Fragments of a Faith Forgotten,
and to turn to the beautiful treatises of the
Hermetic schools, to persuade us that in the
first century the striving after the religious and
philosophic life was wide-spread and various.</p>

<p>We are not, however, among those who
believe that the origin of the Therapeut communities
of Philo and of the Essenes of Philo
and Josephus is to be traced to Orphic and
Pythagorean influence. The question of precise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
origin is as yet beyond the power of historical
research, and we are not of those who would
exaggerate one element of the mass into a universal
source. But when we remember the existence
of all these so widely scattered communities
in the first century, when we study the imperfect
but important record of the very numerous
schools and brotherhoods of a like nature which
came into intimate contact with Christianity in
its origins, we cannot but feel that there was the
leaven of a strong religious life working in many
parts of the Empire.</p>

<p>Our great difficulty is that these communities,
brotherhoods, and associations kept themselves
apart, and with rare exceptions left no records
of their intimate practices and beliefs, or if they
left any it has been destroyed or lost. For the
most part then we have to rely upon general
indications of a very superficial character. But
this imperfect record is no justification for us to
deny or ignore their existence and the intensity
of their endeavours; and a history which purports
to paint a picture of the times is utterly insufficient
so long as it omits this most vital subject
from its canvas.</p>

<p>Among such surroundings as these Apollonius
moved; but how little does his biographer seem
to have been aware of the fact! Philostratus
has a rhetorician&#8217;s appreciation of a philosophical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
court life, but no feeling for the life of religion.
It is only indirectly that the Life of Apollonius,
as it is now depicted, can throw any light on
these most interesting communities, but even an
occasional side-light is precious where all is in
such obscurity. Were it but possible to enter
into the living memory of Apollonius, and see
with his eyes the things he saw when he lived
nineteen hundred years ago, what an enormously
interesting page of the world&#8217;s history could be
recovered! He not only traversed all the
countries where the new faith was taking root,
but he lived for years in most of them, and was
intimately acquainted with numbers of mystic
communities in Egypt, Arabia, and Syria.
Surely he must have visited some of the earliest
Christian communities as well, must even have
conversed with some of the &#8220;disciples of the
Lord&#8221;! And yet no word is breathed of this,
not one single scrap of information on these
points do we glean from what is recorded of him.
Surely he must have met with Paul, if not elsewhere,
then at Rome, in 66, when he had to
leave because of the edict of banishment against
the philosophers, the very year according to some
when Paul was beheaded!</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section III.</span></h4>

<h3>INDIA AND GREECE.</h3>

<p>There is, however, another reason why Apollonius
is of importance to us. He was an
enthusiastic admirer of the wisdom of India.
Here again a subject of wide interest opens up.
What influences, if any, had Br&#257;hmanism and
Buddhism on Western thought in these early
years? It is strongly asserted by some that
they had great influence; it is as strongly denied
by others that they had any influence at all. It
is, therefore, apparent that there is no really
indisputable evidence on the subject.</p>

<p>Just as some would ascribe the constitution
of the Essene and Therapeut communities to
Pythagorean influence, so others would ascribe
their origin to Buddhist propaganda; and not
only would they trace this influence in the
Essene tenets and practices, but they would
even refer the general teaching of the Christ to
a Buddhist source in a Jewish monotheistic
setting. Not only so, but some would have it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
that two centuries before the direct general
contact of Greece with India, brought about
by the conquests of Alexander, India through
Pythagoras strongly and lastingly influenced
all subsequent Greek thought.</p>

<p>The question can certainly not be settled by
hasty affirmation or denial; it requires not only
a wide knowledge of general history and a
minute study of scattered and imperfect indications
of thought and practice, but also a fine
appreciation of the correct value of indirect
evidence, for of direct testimony there is none
of a really decisive nature. To such high qualifications
we can make no pretension, and our
highest ambition is simply to give a few
very general indications of the nature of the
subject.</p>

<p>It is plainly asserted by the ancient Greeks
that Pythagoras went to India, but as the statement
is made by Neo-Pythagorean and Neo-Platonic
writers subsequent to the time of
Apollonius, it is objected that the travels of the
Tyanean suggested not only this item in the
biography of the great Samian but several others,
or even that Apollonius himself in his Life of
Pythagoras was father of the rumour. The
close resemblance, however, between many of the
features of Pythagorean discipline and doctrine
and Indo-Aryan thought and practice, make us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
hesitate entirely to reject the possibility of
Pythagoras having visited ancient &#256;ry&#257;varta.</p>

<p>And even if we cannot go so far as to entertain
the possibility of direct personal contact,
there has to be taken into consideration the fact
that Pherecydes, the master of Pythagoras, may
have been acquainted with some of the main
ideas of Vaidic lore. Pherecydes taught at
Ephesus, but was himself most probably a Persian,
and it is quite credible that a learned
Asiatic, teaching a mystic philosophy and basing
his doctrine upon the idea of rebirth, may have
had some indirect, if not direct, knowledge of
Indo-Aryan thought.</p>

<p>Persia must have been even at this time in
close contact with India, for about the date of
the death of Pythagoras, in the reign of Dareius,
son of Hystaspes, at the end of the sixth and
beginning of the fifth century before our era,
we hear of the expedition of the Persian general
Scylax down the Indus, and learn from Herodotus
that in this reign India (that is the
Punj&#257;b) formed the twentieth satrapy of the
Persian monarchy. Moreover, Indian troops
were among the hosts of Xerxes; they invaded
Thessaly and fought at Plat&aelig;a.</p>

<p>From the time of Alexander onwards there
was direct and constant contact between &#256;ry&#257;varta
and the kingdoms of the successors of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
world-conqueror, and many Greeks wrote about
this land of mystery; but in all that has come
down to us we look in vain for anything but the
vaguest indications of what the &#8220;philosophers&#8221;
of India systematically thought.</p>

<p>That the Br&#257;hmans would at this time have
permitted their sacred books to be read by the
Yavanas (Ionians, the general name for Greeks
in Indian records) is contrary to all we know of
their history. The Yavanas were Mlechchhas,
outside the pale of the &#256;ryas, and all they could
glean of the jealously guarded Brahm&#257;-vidy&#257;
or theosophy must have depended solely upon
outside observation. But the dominant religious
activity at this time in India was Buddhist, and
it is to this protest against the rigid distinctions
of caste and race made by Br&#257;hmanical pride,
and to the startling novelty of an enthusiastic
religious propaganda among all classes and races
in India, and outside India to all nations, that
we must look for the most direct contact of
thought between India and Greece.</p>

<p>For instance, in the middle of the third century
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, we know from Asoka&#8217;s thirteenth edict, that
this Buddhist Emperor of India, the Constantine
of the East, sent missionaries to Antiochus II. of
Syria, Ptolemy II. of Egypt, Antigonus Gonatas
of Macedonia, Magas of Cyrene, and Alexander
II. of Epirus. When, in a land of such imperfect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
records, the evidence on the side of India is so
clear and indubitable, all the more extraordinary
is it that we have no direct testimony on our side
of so great a missionary activity. Although, then,
merely because of the absence of all direct information
from Greek sources, it is very unsafe to
generalize, nevertheless from our general knowledge
of the times it is not illegitimate to conclude
that no great public stir could have been
made by these pioneers of the Dharma in the West.
In every probability these Buddhist Bhik&#7779;hus
produced no effect on the rulers or on the people.
But was their mission entirely abortive; and did
Buddhist missionary enterprise westwards cease
with them?</p>

<p>The answer to this question, as it seems to
us, is hidden in the obscurity of the religious
communities. We cannot, however, go so far as
to agree with those who would cut the gordian
knot by asserting dogmatically that the ascetic
communities in Syria and Egypt were founded
by these Buddhist propagandists. Already even
in Greece itself were not only Pythagorean but
even prior to them Orphic communities, for even
on this ground we believe that Pythagoras rather
developed what he found already existing, than
that he established something entirely new. And
if they were found in Greece, much more then is
it reasonable to suppose that such communities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
already existed in Syria, Arabia, and Egypt, whose
populations were given far more to religious
exercises than the sceptical and laughter-loving
Greeks.</p>

<p>It is, however, credible that in such communities,
if anywhere, Buddhist propaganda would find an
appreciative and attentive audience; but even so
it is remarkable that they have left no distinctly
direct trace of their influence. Nevertheless, both
by the sea way and by the great caravan route there
was an ever open line of communication between
India and the Empire of the successors of Alexander;
and it is even permissible to speculate, that
if we could recover a catalogue of the great Alexandrian
library, for instance, we should perchance
find that in it Indian MSS. were to be found
among the other rolls and parchments of the
scriptures of the nations.</p>

<p>Indeed, there are phrases in the oldest treatises
of the Trismegistic Hermetic literature which can
be so closely paralleled with phrases in the Upani&#7779;hads
and in the Bhagavad G&#299;t&#257;, that one is almost
tempted to believe that the writers had some
acquaintance with the general contents of these
Br&#257;hmanical scriptures. The Trismegistic literature
had its genesis in Egypt, and its earliest
deposit must be dated at least in the first century
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, if it cannot even be pushed back earlier.
Even more striking is the similarity between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
lofty mystic metaphysic of the Gnostic doctor
Basilides, who lived at the end of the first and
beginning of the second century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and Ved&#257;ntic
ideas. Moreover, both the Hermetic and the
Basilidean schools and their immediate predecessors
were devoted to a stern self-discipline
and deep philosophical study which would make
them welcome eagerly any philosopher or mystic
student who might come from the far East.</p>

<p>But even so, we are not of those who by their
own self-imposed limitations of possibility are
condemned to find some direct physical contact to
account for a similarity of ideas or even of phrasing.
Granting, for instance, that there is much resemblance
between the teachings of the Dharma
of the Buddha and of the Gospel of the Christ,
and that the same spirit of love and gentleness
pervades them both, still there is no necessity to
look for the reason of this resemblance to purely
physical transmission. And so for other schools
and other teachers; like conditions will produce
similar phenomena; like effort and like aspiration
will produce similar ideas, similar experience, and
similar response. And this we believe to be the
case in no general way, but that it is all very
definitely ordered from within by the servants
of the real guardians of things religious in this
world.</p>

<p>We are, then, not compelled to lay so much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
stress on the question of physical transmission,
or to be seeking even to find proof of copying.
The human mind in its various degrees is much
the same in all climes and ages, and its inner
experience has a common ground into which seed
may be sown, as it is tilled and cleared of weeds.
The good seed comes all from the same granary,
and those who sow it pay no attention to the
man-made outer distinctions of race and creed.</p>

<p>However difficult, therefore, it may be to
prove, from unquestionably historical statements,
any direct influence of Indian thought on the
conceptions and practices of some of these
religious communities and philosophic schools
of the Gr&aelig;co-Roman Empire, and although in
any particular case similarity of ideas need not
necessarily be assigned to direct physical transmission,
nevertheless the highest probability, if
not the greatest assurance, remains that even
prior to the days of Apollonius there was some
private knowledge in Greece of the general ideas
of the Ved&#257;nta and Dharma; while in the case
of Apollonius himself, even if we discount nine-tenths
of what is related of him, his one idea
seems to have been to spread abroad among the
religious brotherhoods and institutions of the
Empire some portion of the wisdom which he
brought back with him from India.</p>

<p>When, then, we find at the end of the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
and during the first half of the second century,
among such mystic associations as the Hermetic
and Gnostic schools, ideas which strongly remind
us of the theosophy of the Upani&#7779;hads or the
reasoned ethics of the Suttas, we have always
to take into consideration not only the high
probability of Apollonius having visited such
schools, but also the possibility of his having
discoursed at length therein on the Indian
wisdom. Not only so, but the memory of his
influence may have lingered for long in such
circles, for do we not find Plotinus, the coryph&aelig;us
of Neo-Platonism, as it is called, so
enamoured with what he had heard of the
wisdom of India at Alexandria, that in 242 he
started off with the ill-starred expedition of
Gordian to the East in the hope of reaching that
land of philosophy? With the failure of the
expedition and assassination of the Emperor,
however, he had to return, for ever disappointed
of his hope.</p>

<p>It is not, however, to be thought that
Apollonius set out to make a propaganda of
Indian philosophy in the same way that the
ordinary missionary sets forth to preach his
conception of the Gospel. By no means;
Apollonius seems to have endeavoured to help
his hearers, whoever they might be, in the way
best suited to each of them. He did not begin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
by telling them that what they believed was
utterly false and soul-destroying, and that their
eternal welfare depended upon their instantly
adopting his own special scheme of salvation;
he simply endeavoured to purge and further
explain what they already believed and
practised. That some strong power supported
him in his ceaseless activity, and in his
almost world-wide task, is not so difficult of
belief; and it is a question of deep interest for
those who strive to peer through the mists of
appearance, to speculate how that not only a
Paul but also an Apollonius was aided and
directed in his task from within.</p>

<p>The day, however, has not yet dawned when
it will be possible for the general mind in the
West to approach the question with such freedom
from prejudice, as to bear the thought that,
seen from within, not only Paul but also
Apollonius may well have been a &#8220;disciple of
the Lord&#8221; in the true sense of the words; and
that too although on the surface of things their
tasks seem in many ways so dissimilar, and even,
to theological preconceptions, entirely antagonistic.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, even to-day there is an
ever-growing number of thinking people who
will not only not be shocked by such a belief, but
who will receive it with joy as the herald of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
dawning of a true sun of righteousness, which
will do more to illumine the manifold ways of
the religion of our common humanity than all
the self-righteousness of any particular body of
exclusive religionists.</p>

<p>It is, then, in this atmosphere of charity and
tolerance that we would ask the reader to
approach the consideration of Apollonius and
his doings, and not only the life and deeds of
an Apollonius, but also of all those who have
striven to help their fellows the world over.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section IV.</span></h4>

<h3>THE APOLLONIUS OF EARLY OPINION.</h3>

<p>Apollonius of Tyana<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> was the most famous
philosopher of the Gr&aelig;co-Roman world of the
first century, and devoted the major part of his
long life to the purification of the many cults of
the Empire and to the instruction of the ministers
and priests of its religions. With the exception
of the Christ no more interesting personage
appears upon the stage of Western history in
these early years. Many and various and ofttimes
mutually contradictory are the opinions
which have been held about Apollonius, for the
account of his life which has come down to us
is in the guise of a romantic story rather than in
the form of a plain history. And this is perhaps
to some extent to be expected, for Apollonius,
besides his public teaching, had a life apart, a
life into which even his favourite disciple does
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>not enter. He journeys into the most distant
lands, and is lost to the world for years; he
enters the shrines of the most sacred temples
and the inner circles of the most exclusive
communities, and what he says or does therein
remains a mystery, or serves only as an opportunity
for the weaving of some fantastic story
by those who did not understand.</p>

<p>The following study will be simply an attempt
to put before the reader a brief sketch of the
problem which the records and traditions of the
life of the famous Tyanean present; but before
we deal with the Life of Apollonius, written by
Flavius Philostratus at the beginning of the
third century, we must give the reader a brief
account of the references to Apollonius among
the classical writers and the Church Fathers, and
a short sketch of the literature of the subject in
more recent times, and of the varying fortunes
of the war of opinion concerning his life in the
last four centuries.</p>

<p>First, then, with regard to the references in
classical and patristic authors. Lucian, the witty
writer of the first half of the second century, makes
the subject of one of his satires the pupil of a
disciple of Apollonius, of one of those who were
acquainted with &#8220;all the tragedy&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> of his life.
And Appuleius, a contemporary of Lucian, classes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>Apollonius with Moses and Zoroaster, and other
famous Magi of antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>About the same period, in a work entitled
Qu&aelig;stiones et Responsiones ad Orthodoxos, formerly
attributed to Justin Martyr, who flourished
in the second quarter of the second century, we
find the following interesting statement:</p>

<p>&#8220;Question 24: If God is the maker and
master of creation, how do the consecrated
objects<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> of Apollonius have power in the
[various] orders of that creation? For, <i>as we
see</i>, they check the fury of the waves and the
power of the winds and the inroads of vermin
and attacks of wild beasts.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>Dion Cassius in his history,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> which he wrote
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 211-222, states that Caracalla (Emp. 211-216)
honoured the memory of Apollonius with
a chapel or monument (<i>heroum</i>).</p>

<p>It was just at this time (216) that Philostratus
composed his Life of Apollonius, at the request
of Domna Julia, Caracalla&#8217;s mother, and it is
with this document principally that we shall
have to deal in the sequel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p><p>Lampridius, who flourished about the middle
of the third century, further informs us that
Alexander Severus (Emp. 222-235) placed
the statue of Apollonius in his <i>lararium</i>
together with those of Christ, Abraham, and
Orpheus.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Vopiscus, writing in the last decade of the
third century, tells us that Aurelian (Emp. 270-275)
vowed a temple to Apollonius, of whom he
had seen a vision when besieging Tyana. Vopiscus
speaks of the Tyanean as &#8220;a sage of the
most wide-spread renown and authority, an
ancient philosopher, and a true friend of the
Gods,&#8221; nay, as a manifestation of deity. &#8220;For
what among men,&#8221; exclaims the historian, &#8220;was
more holy, what more worthy of reverence, what
more venerable, what more god-like than he?
He, it was, who gave life to the dead. He, it
was, who did and said so many things beyond
the power of men.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> So enthusiastic is Vopiscus
about Apollonius, that he promises, if he lives,
to write a short account of his life in Latin, so
that his deeds and words may be on the tongue
of all, for as yet the only accounts are in Greek.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
Vopiscus, however, did not fulfil his promise, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>we learn that about this date both Soterichus<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
and Nichomachus wrote Lives of our philosopher,
and shortly afterwards Tascius Victorianus,
working on the papers of Nichomachus,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> also
composed a Life. None of these Lives, however,
have reached us.</p>

<p>It was just at this period also, namely, in the
last years of the third century and the first years
of the fourth, that Porphyry and Iamblichus
composed their treatises on Pythagoras and his
school; both mention Apollonius as one of their
authorities, and it is probable that the first 30 sections
of Iamblichus are taken from Apollonius.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>We now come to an incident which hurled the
character of Apollonius into the arena of Christian
polemics, where it has been tossed about until
the present day. Hierocles, successively governor
of Palmyra, Bithynia, and Alexandria, and a
philosopher, about the year 305 wrote a criticism
on the claims of the Christians, in two books,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>called A Truthful Address to the Christians,
or more shortly The Truth-lover. He seems
to have based himself for the most part on the
previous works of Celsus and Porphyry,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> but
introduced a new subject of controversy by
opposing the wonderful works of Apollonius to
the claims of the Christians to exclusive right
in &#8220;miracles&#8221; as proof of the divinity of their
Master. In this part of his treatise Hierocles
used Philostratus&#8217; Life of Apollonius.</p>

<p>To this pertinent criticism of Hierocles
Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea immediately replied in a
treatise still extant, entitled Contra Hieroclem.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
Eusebius admits that Apollonius was a wise and
virtuous man, but denies that there is sufficient
proof that the wonderful things ascribed to him
ever took place; and even if they did take place,
they were the work of &#8220;d&aelig;mons,&#8221; and not of
God. The treatise of Eusebius is interesting; he
severely scrutinises the statements in Philostratus,
and shows himself possessed of a first rate critical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>faculty. Had he only used the same faculty
on the documents of the Church, of which he
was the first historian, posterity would have
owed him an eternal debt of gratitude. But
Eusebius, like so many other apologists, could
only see one side; justice, when anything touching
Christianity was called into question, was a
stranger to his mind, and he would have considered
it blasphemy to use his critical faculty
on the documents which relate the &#8220;miracles&#8221; of
Jesus. Still the problem of &#8220;miracle&#8221; was the
same, as Hierocles pointed out, and remains the
same to this day.</p>

<p>After the controversy reincarnated again in
the sixteenth century, and when the hypothesis
of the &#8220;Devil&#8221; as the prime-mover in all
&#8220;miracles&#8221; but those of the Church lost its hold
with the progress of scientific thought, the nature
of the wonders related in the Life of Apollonius
was still so great a difficulty that it gave rise
to a new hypothesis of plagiarism. The life of
Apollonius was a Pagan plagiarism of the life
of Jesus. But Eusebius and the Fathers who
followed him had no suspicion of this; they lived
in times when such an assertion could have been
easily refuted. There is not a word in Philostratus
to show he had any acquaintance with the life
of Jesus, and fascinating as Baur&#8217;s &#8220;tendency-writing&#8221;
theory is to many, we can only say that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
as a plagiarist of the Gospel story Philostratus
is a conspicuous failure. Philostratus writes the
history of a good and wise man, a man with a
mission of teaching, clothed in the wonder stories
preserved in the memory and embellished by the
imagination of fond posterity, but not the drama
of incarnate Deity as the fulfilment of world-prophecy.</p>

<p>Lactantius, writing about 315, also attacked
the treatise of Hierocles, who seems to have put
forward some very pertinent criticisms; for the
Church Father says that he enumerates so many
of their Christian inner teachings (<i>intima</i>) that
sometimes he would seem to have at one time
undergone the same training (<i>disciplina</i>). But
it is in vain, says Lactantius, that Hierocles
endeavours to show that Apollonius performed
similar or even greater deeds than Jesus, for
Christians do not believe that Christ is God
because he did wonderful things, but because all
the things wrought in him were those which
were announced by the prophets.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> And in
taking this ground Lactantius saw far more
clearly than Eusebius the weakness of the proof
from &#8220;miracle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arnobius, the teacher of Lactantius, however,
writing at the end of the third century, before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>the controversy, in referring to Apollonius simply
classes him among Magi, such as Zoroaster and
others mentioned in the passage of Appuleius to
which we have already referred.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>But even after the controversy there is a wide
difference of opinion among the Fathers, for
although at the end of the fourth century John
Chrysostom with great bitterness calls Apollonius
a deceiver and evil-doer, and declares that the
whole of the incidents in his life are unqualified
fiction,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Jerome, on the contrary, at the very
same date, takes almost a favourable view, for, after
perusing Philostratus, he writes that Apollonius
found everywhere something to learn and something
whereby he might become a better man.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
At the beginning of the fifth century also Augustine,
while ridiculing any attempt at comparison
between Apollonius and Jesus, says that the
character of the Tyanean was &#8220;far superior&#8221; to
that ascribed to Jove, in respect of virtue.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p><p>About the same date also we find Isidorus of
Pelusium, who died in 450, bluntly denying that
there is any truth in the claim made by &#8220;certain,&#8221;
whom he does not further specify, that
Apollonius of Tyana &#8220;consecrated many spots in
many parts of the world for the safety of the
inhabitants.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> It is instructive to compare the
denial of Isidorus with the passage we have
already quoted from Pseudo-Justin. The writer
of Questions and Answers to the Orthodox in the
second century could not dispose of the question
by a blunt denial; he had to admit it and argue
the case on other grounds&mdash;namely, the agency
of the Devil. Nor can the argument of the
Fathers, that Apollonius used magic to bring
about his results, while the untaught Christians
could perform healing wonders by a single word,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
be accepted as valid by the unprejudiced critic,
for there is no evidence to support the contention
that Apollonius employed such methods for his
wonder-workings; on the contrary, both Apollonius
himself and his biographer Philostratus
strenuously repudiate the charge of magic
brought against him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a few years later, Sidonius
Apollinaris, Bishop of Claremont, speaks in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>highest terms of Apollonius. Sidonius translated
the Life of Apollonius into Latin for Leon, the
councillor of King Euric, and in writing to his
friend he says: &#8220;Read the life of a man who
(religion apart) resembles you in many things; a
man sought out by the rich, yet who never sought
for riches; who loved wisdom and despised
gold; a man frugal in the midst of feastings,
clad in linen in the midst of those clothed in
purple, austere in the midst of luxury.... In
fine, to speak plainly, perchance no historian will
find in ancient times a philosopher whose life is
equal to that of Apollonius.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>Thus we see that even among the Church
Fathers opinions were divided; while among the
philosophers themselves the praise of Apollonius
was unstinted.</p>

<p>For Ammianus Marcellinus, &#8220;the last subject
of Rome who composed a profane history in the
Latin language,&#8221; and the friend of Julian the
philosopher-emperor, refers to the Tyanean as
&#8220;that most renowned philosopher8221;;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> while a
few years later Eunapius, the pupil of Chrysanthius,
one of the teachers of Julian, writing in
the last years of the fourth century, says that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>Apollonius was more than a philosopher; he was
&#8220;a middle term, as it were, between gods and
men.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> Not only was Apollonius an adherent
of the Pythagorean philosophy, but &#8220;he fully
exemplified the more divine and practical side
in it.&#8221; In fact Philostratus should have called
his biography &#8220;The Sojourning of a God among
Men.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> This seemingly wildly exaggerated estimate
may perhaps receive explanation in the fact
that Eunapius belonged to a school which knew the
nature of the attainments ascribed to Apollonius.</p>

<p>Indeed, &#8220;as late as the fifth century we find
one Volusian, a proconsul of Africa, descended
from an old Roman family and still strongly
attached to the religion of his ancestors, almost
worshipping Apollonius of Tyana as a supernatural
being.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p><p>Even after the downfall of philosophy we find
Cassiodorus, who spent the last years of his long
life in a monastery, speaking of Apollonius as
the &#8220;renowned philosopher.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> So also among
Byzantine writers, the monk George Syncellus,
in the eighth century, refers several times to
our philosopher, and not only without the
slightest adverse criticism, but he declares that
he was the first and most remarkable of all the
illustrious people who appeared under the
Empire.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Tzetzes also, the critic and grammarian,
calls Apollonius &#8220;all-wise and a fore-knower
of all things.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>And though the monk Xiphilinus, in the
eleventh century, in a note to his abridgment
of the history of Dion Cassius, calls Apollonius
a clever juggler and magician,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> nevertheless
Cedrenus in the same century bestows on
Apollonius the not uncomplimentary title of an
&#8220;adept Pythagorean philosopher,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> and relates
several instances of the efficacy of his powers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>in Byzantium. In fact, if we can believe
Nicetas, as late as the thirteenth century there
were at Byzantium certain bronze doors, formerly
consecrated by Apollonius, which had to
be melted down because they had become an
object of superstition even for the Christians
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>Had the work of Philostratus disappeared
with the rest of the Lives, the above would be all
that we should have known about Apollonius.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
Little enough, it is true, concerning so distinguished
a character, yet ample enough to
show that, with the exception of theological
prejudice, the suffrages of antiquity were all on
the side of our philosopher.</p>

<h3>TEXTS, TRANSLATIONS, AND
LITERATURE.</h3>

<p>We will now turn to the texts, translations,
and general literature of the subject in more
recent times. Apollonius returned to the
memory of the world, after the oblivion of the
dark ages, with evil auspices. From the very
beginning the old Hierocles-Eusebius controversy
was revived, and the whole subject was at
once taken out of the calm region of philosophy
and history and hurled once more into the stormy
arena of religious bitterness and prejudice. For
long Aldus hesitated to print the text of
Philostratus, and only finally did so (in 1501)
with the text of Eusebius as an appendix, so that,
as he piously phrases it, &#8220;the antidote might accompany
the poison.&#8221; Together with it appeared
a Latin translation by the Florentine Rinucci.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>
<p>In addition to the Latin version the sixteenth
century also produced an Italian<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> and French
translation.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>The <i>editio princeps</i> of Aldus was superseded
a century later by the edition of Morel,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> which
in its turn was followed a century still later by
that of Olearius.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Nearly a century and a half
later again the text of Olearius was superseded
by that of Kayser (the first critical text), whose
work in its last edition contains the latest critical
apparatus.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> All information with regard to the
MSS. will be found in Kayser&#8217;s Latin Prefaces.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p><p>We shall now attempt to give some idea of
the general literature on the subject, so that the
reader may be able to note some of the varying
fortunes of the war of opinion in the bibliographical
indications. And if the general reader
should be impatient of the matter and eager to
get to something of greater interest, he can easily
omit its perusal; while if he be a lover of the
mystic way, and does not take delight in wrangling
controversy, he may at least sympathise
with the writer, who has been compelled to look
through the works of the last century and a good
round dozen of those of the previous centuries,
before he could venture on an opinion of his own
with a clear conscience.</p>

<p>Sectarian prejudice against Apollonius characterises
nearly every opinion prior to the
nineteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Of books distinctly
dedicated to the subject the works of the Abb&eacute;
Dupin<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> and of de Tillemont<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> are bitter attacks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>on the Philosopher of Tyana in defence of the
monopoly of Christian miracles; while those of
the Abb&eacute; Houtteville<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> and L&uuml;derwald<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> are less
violent, though on the same lines. A pseudonymous
writer, however, of the eighteenth century
strikes out a somewhat different line by classing
together the miracles of the Jesuits and other
Monastic Orders with those of Apollonius, and
dubbing them all spurious, while maintaining
the sole authenticity of those of Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Bacon and Voltaire speak of
Apollonius in the highest terms,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> and even a
century before the latter the English Deist,
Charles Blount,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> raised his voice against the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>universal obloquy poured upon the character of
the Tyanean; his work, however, was speedily
suppressed.</p>

<p>In the midst of this war about miracles in the
eighteenth century it is pleasant to remark the
short treatise of Herzog, who endeavours to give
a sketch of the philosophy and religious life of
Apollonius,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> but, alas! there were no followers of
so liberal an example in this century of strife.</p>

<p>So far then for the earlier literature of the
subject. Frankly none of it is worth reading;
the problem could not be calmly considered in such
a period. It started on the false ground of the
Hierocles-Eusebius controversy, which was but an
incident (for wonder-working is common to all
great teachers and not peculiar to Apollonius
or Jesus), and was embittered by the rise of
Encyclop&aelig;dism and the rationalism of the
Revolution period. Not that the miracle-controversy
ceased even in the last century; it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>does not, however, any longer obscure the whole
horizon, and the sun of a calmer judgment
may be seen breaking through the mist.</p>

<p>In order to make the rest of our summary
clearer we append at the end of this essay the
titles of the works which have appeared since
the beginning of the nineteenth century, in
chronological order.</p>

<p>A glance over this list will show that the last
century has produced an English (Berwick&#8217;s),
an Italian (Lancetti&#8217;s), a French (Chassang&#8217;s),
and two German translations (Jacobs&#8217; and
Baltzer&#8217;s).<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> The Rev. E. Berwick&#8217;s translation
is the only English version; in his Preface the
author, while asserting the falsity of the miraculous
element in the Life, says that the rest
of the work deserves careful attention. No harm
will accrue to the Christian religion by its perusal,
for there are no allusions to the Life of
Christ in it, and the miracles are based on those
ascribed to Pythagoras.</p>

<p>This is certainly a healthier standpoint than
that of the traditional theological controversy,
which, unfortunately, however, was revived
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>again by the great authority of Baur, who saw
in a number of the early documents of the
Christian era (notably the canonical Acts)
tendency-writings of but slight historical content,
representing the changing fortunes of
schools and parties and not the actual histories
of individuals. The Life of Apollonius was one
of these tendency-writings; its object was to put
forward a view opposed to Christianity in favour
of philosophy. Baur thus divorced the whole
subject from its historical standpoint and
attributed to Philostratus an elaborate scheme
of which he was entirely innocent. Baur&#8217;s view
was largely adopted by Zeller in his Philosophie
der Griechen (v. 140), and by R&eacute;ville in Holland.</p>

<p>This &#8220;Christusbild&#8221; theory (carried by a few
extremists to the point of denying that Apollonius
ever existed) has had a great vogue among
writers on the subject, especially compilers of
encyclop&aelig;dia articles; it is at any rate a wider
issue than the traditional miracle-wrangle, which
was again revived in all its ancient narrowness
by Newman, who only uses Apollonius as an
excuse for a dissertation on orthodox miracles,
to which he devotes eighteen pages out of the
twenty-five of his treatise. Noack also follows
Baur, and to some extent Pettersch, though he
takes the subject onto the ground of philosophy;
while M&ouml;nckeberg, pastor of St. Nicolai in Ham<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>burg,
though striving to be fair to Apollonius,
ends his chatty dissertation with an outburst of
orthodox praises of Jesus, praises which we by no
means grudge, but which are entirely out of place
in such a subject.</p>

<p>The development of the Jesus-Apollonius
miracle-controversy into the Jesus-against-Apollonius
and even Christ-against-Anti-Christ
battle, fought out with relays of lusty champions
on the one side against a feeble protest at best on
the other, is a painful spectacle to contemplate.
How sadly must Jesus and Apollonius have
looked upon, and still look upon, this bitter and
useless strife over their saintly persons. Why
should posterity set their memories one against
the other? Did they oppose one another in life?
Did even their biographers do so after their
deaths? Why then could not the controversy
have ceased with Eusebius? For Lactantius
frankly admits the point brought forward by
Hierocles (to exemplify which Hierocles only
referred to Apollonius as one instance out of
many)&mdash;that &#8220;miracles&#8221; do not prove divinity.
We rest our claims, says Lactantius, <i>not</i> on
miracles, but on the fulfilment of prophecy.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
Had this more sensible position been revived
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>instead of that of Eusebius, the problem of Apollonius
would have been considered in its natural
historical environment four hundred years ago,
and much ink and paper would have been saved.</p>

<p>With the progress of the critical method,
however, opinion has at length partly recovered
its balance, and it is pleasant to be able to turn
to works which have rescued the subject from
theological obscurantism and placed it in the
open field of historical and critical research. The
two volumes of the independent thinker, Legrand
d&#8217;Aussy, which appeared at the very beginning
of the last century, are, for the time, remarkably
free from prejudice, and are a praiseworthy
attempt at historical impartiality, but criticism
was still young at this period. Kayser, though
he does not go thoroughly into the matter,
decides that the account of Philostratus is purely
a &#8220;<i>fabularis narratio</i>&#8221; but is well opposed by
I. M&uuml;ller, who contends for a strong element of
history as a background. But by far the
best sifting of the sources is that of Jessen.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>
Priaulx&#8217;s study deals solely with the Indian
episode and is of no critical value for the
estimation of the sources. Of all previous
studies, however, the works of Chassang and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>Baltzer are the most generally intelligent, for
both writers are aware of the possibilities of
psychic science, though mostly from the insufficient
standpoint of spiritistic phenomena.</p>

<p>As for Tredwell&#8217;s somewhat pretentious
volume which, being in English, is accessible to
the general reader, it is largely reactionary, and
is used as a cover for adverse criticism of the
Christian origins from a Secularist standpoint
which denies at the outset the possibility of
&#8220;miracle&#8221; in any meaning of the word. A mass
of well-known numismatological and other
matter, which is entirely irrelevant, but which
seems to be new and surprising to the author, is
introduced, and a map is prefixed to the title-page
purporting to give the itineraries of Apollonius,
but having little reference to the text of
Philostratus. Indeed, nowhere does Tredwell
show that he is working on the text itself, and
the subject in his hands is but an excuse for a
rambling dissertation on the first century in
general from his own standpoint.</p>

<p>This is all regrettable, for with the exception
of Berwick&#8217;s translation, which is almost unprocurable,
we have nothing of value in English
for the general reader,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> except Sinnett&#8217;s short
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>sketch, which is descriptive rather than critical
or explanatory.</p>

<p>So far then for the history of the Apollonius
of opinion; we will now turn to the Apollonius
of Philostratus, and attempt if possible to
discover some traces of the man as he was in
history, and the nature of his life and work.</p>

<h3>THE BIOGRAPHER OF APOLLONIUS.</h3>

<p>Flavius Philostratus, the writer of the only
Life of Apollonius which has come down to us,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
was a distinguished man of letters who lived in
the last quarter of the second and the first half
of the third century (<i>cir.</i> 175-245 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>). He
formed one of the circle of famous writers and
thinkers gathered round the philosopher-empress,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
Julia Domna, who was the guiding
spirit of the Empire during the reigns of her husband
Septimius Severus and her son Caracalla.
All three members of the imperial family were
students of occult science, and the age was preeminently
one in which the occult arts, good and
bad, were a passion. Thus the sceptical Gibbon,
in his sketch of Severus and his famous consort,
writes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Like most of the Africans, Severus was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>passionately addicted to the vain studies of
magic and divination, deeply versed in the
interpretation of dreams and omens, and perfectly
acquainted with the science of judicial astrology,
which in almost every age except the present,
has maintained its dominion over the mind of
man. He had lost his first wife whilst he was
governor of the Lionnese Gaul. In the choice
of a second, he sought only to connect himself
with some favourite of fortune; and as soon as
he had discovered that a young lady of Emesa
in Syria had <i>a royal nativity</i><a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> he solicited and
obtained her hand. Julia Domna<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> (for that
was her name) deserved all that the stars could
promise her. She possessed, even in an advanced
age,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> the attractions of beauty, and united to a
lively imagination a firmness of mind, and
strength of judgment, seldom bestowed on her
sex. Her amiable qualities never made any
deep impression on the dark and jealous temper
of her husband,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> but in her son&#8217;s reign, she
administered the principal affairs of the Empire
with a prudence that supported his authority,
and with a moderation that sometimes corrected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>his wild extravagances. Julia applied herself to
letters and philosophy with some success, and
with the most splendid reputation. She was the
patroness of every art, and the friend of every
man of genius.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>We thus see, even from Gibbon&#8217;s somewhat
grudging estimate, that Domna Julia was a
woman of remarkable character, whose outer acts
give evidence of an inner purpose, and whose
private life has not been written. It was at
her request that Philostratus wrote the Life of
Apollonius, and it was she who supplied him
with certain MSS. that were in her possession, as
a basis; for the beautiful daughter of Bassianus,
priest of the sun at Emesa, was an ardent
collector of books from every part of the world,
especially of the MSS. of philosophers and of
memoranda and biographical notes relating to
the famous students of the inner nature of
things.</p>

<p>That Philostratus was the best man to whom
to entrust so important a task, is doubtful. It
is true that he was a skilled stylist and a
practised man of letters, an art critic and an
ardent antiquarian, as we may see from his other
works; but he was a sophist rather than a philosopher,
and though an enthusiastic admirer of
Pythagoras and his school, was so from a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>distance, regarding it rather through a wonder-loving
atmosphere of curiosity and the embellishments
of a lively imagination than from a
personal acquaintance with its discipline, or a
practical knowledge of those hidden forces of
the soul with which its adepts dealt. We have,
therefore, to expect a sketch of the appearance
of a thing by one outside, rather than
an exposition of the thing itself from one
within.</p>

<p>The following is Philostratus&#8217; account of the
sources from which he derived his information
concerning Apollonius:<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>&#8220;I have collected my materials partly from
the cities which loved him, partly from the
temples whose rites and regulations he restored
from their former state of neglect, partly from
what others have said about him, and partly
from his own letters.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> More detailed information
I procured as follows. Damis was a
man of some education who formerly used to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>live in the ancient city of Ninus.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> He became
a disciple of Apollonius and recorded his
travels, in which he says he himself took part,
and also the views, sayings, and predictions of
his master. A member of Damis&#8217; family brought
the Empress Julia the note-books<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> containing
these memoirs, which up to that time had not
been known of. As I was one of the circle of
this princess, who was a lover and patroness of
all literary productions, she ordered me to rewrite
these sketches and improve their form of
expression, for though the Ninevite expressed
himself clearly, his style was far from correct.
I also have had access to a book by Maximus<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
of &AElig;g&aelig; which contained all Apollonius&#8217; doings
at &AElig;g&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> There is also a will written by Apollonius,
from which we can learn how he almost
deified philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> As to the four books of
M&#339;ragenes<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> on Apollonius they do not deserve
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>attention, for he knows nothing of most of the
facts of his life&#8221; (i. 2, 3).</p>

<p>These are the sources to which Philostratus
was indebted for his information, sources which
are unfortunately no longer accessible to us,
except perhaps a few letters. Nor did Philostratus
spare any pains to gather information on
the subject, for in his concluding words (viii. 31),
he tells us that he has himself travelled into
most parts of the &#8220;world&#8221; and everywhere met
with the &#8220;inspired sayings&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> of Apollonius, and
that he was especially well acquainted with the
temple dedicated to the memory of our philosopher
at Tyana and founded at the imperial
expense (&#8220;for the emperors had judged him not
unworthy of like honours with themselves&#8221;),
whose priests, it is to be presumed, had got
together as much information as they could
concerning Apollonius.</p>

<p>A thoroughly critical analysis of the literary
effort of Philostratus, therefore, would have to
take into account all of these factors, and endeavour
to assign each statement to its original
source. But even then the task of the historian
would be incomplete, for it is transparently
evident that Philostratus has considerably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>&#8220;embellished&#8221; the narrative with numerous
notes and additions of his own and with the
composition of set speeches.</p>

<p>Now as the ancient writers did not separate
their notes from the text, or indicate them in
any distinct fashion, we have to be constantly
on our guard to detect the original sources from
the glosses of the writer.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> In fact Philostratus
is ever taking advantage of the mention of a
name or a subject to display his own knowledge,
which is often of a most legendary and fantastic
nature. This is especially the case in his description
of Apollonius&#8217; Indian travels. India at
that time and long afterwards was considered
the &#8220;end of the world,&#8221; and an infinity of the
strangest &#8220;travellers&#8217; tales&#8221; and mythological
fables were in circulation concerning it. One
has only to read the accounts of the writers on
India<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> from the time of Alexander onwards to
discover the source of most of the strange inci<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>dents
that Philostratus records as experiences
of Apollonius. To take but one instance out of
a hundred, Apollonius had to cross the Caucasus,
an indefinite name for the great system of
mountain ranges that bound the northern limits
of &#256;ry&#257;varta. Prometheus was chained to the
Caucasus, so every child had been told for
centuries. Therefore, if Apollonius crossed the
Caucasus, he must have seen those chains. And
so it was, Philostratus assures us (ii. 3). Not
only so, but he volunteers the additional information
that you could not tell of what they were
made! A perusal of Megasthenes, however, will
speedily reduce the long Philostratian account of
the Indian travels of Apollonius (i. 41-iii. 58)
to a very narrow compass, for page after page is
simply padding, picked up from any one of the
numerous Indica to which our widely read author
had access.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> To judge from such writers,
Porus<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> (the R&#257;j&#257;h conquered by Alexander)
was the immemorial king of India. In fact, in
speaking of India or any other little-known
country, a writer in these days had to drag in
all that popular legend associated with it or he
stood little chance of being listened to. He had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>to give his narrative a &#8220;local colour,&#8221; and this
was especially the case in a technical rhetorical
effort like that of Philostratus.</p>

<p>Again, it was the fashion to insert set speeches
and put them in the mouths of well-known
characters on historical occasions, good instances
of which may be seen in Thucydides and the
Acts of the Apostles. Philostratus repeatedly
does this.</p>

<p>But it would be too long to enter into a
detailed investigation of the subject, although
the writer has prepared notes on all these points,
for that would be to write a volume and not a
sketch. Only a few points are therefore set
down, to warn the student to be ever on his
guard to sift out Philostratus from his sources.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>But though we must be keenly alive to the
importance of a thoroughly critical attitude
where definite facts of history are concerned, we
should be as keenly on our guard against judging
everything from the standpoint of modern
preconceptions. There is but one religious literature
of antiquity that has ever been treated
with real sympathy in the West, and that is the
Jud&aelig;o-Christian; in that alone have men been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>trained to feel at home, and all in antiquity that
treats of religion in a different mode to the
Jewish or Christian way, is felt to be strange, and,
if obscure or extraordinary, to be even repulsive.
The sayings and doings of the Jewish prophets,
of Jesus, and of the Apostles, are related with
reverence, embellished with the greatest beauties
of diction, and illumined with the best thought
of the age; while the sayings and doings of other
prophets and teachers have been for the most
part subjected to the most unsympathetic criticism,
in which no attempt is made to understand
their standpoint. Had even-handed justice been
dealt out all round, the world to-day would have
been richer in sympathy, in wide-mindedness, in
comprehension of nature, humanity, and God, in
brief, in soul-experience.</p>

<p>Therefore, in reading the Life of Apollonius let
us remember that we have to look at it through
the eyes of a Greek, and not through those of
a Jew or a Protestant. The Many in their
proper sphere must be for us as authentic a manifestation
of the Divine as the One or the All, for
indeed the &#8220;Gods&#8221; exist in spite of commandment
and creed. The Saints and Martyrs and
Angels have seemingly taken the places of the
Heroes and D&aelig;mons and Gods, but the change
of name and change of view-point among men
affect but little the unchangeable facts. To sense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
the facts of universal religion under the ever-changing
names which men bestow upon them,
and then to enter with full sympathy and comprehension
into the hopes and fears of every
phase of the religious mind&mdash;to read, as it were,
the past lives of our own souls&mdash;is a most difficult
task. But until we can put ourselves understandingly
in the places of others, we can never
see more than one side of the Infinite Life of God.
A student of comparative religion must not be
afraid of terms; he must not shudder when he
meets with &#8220;polytheism,&#8221; or draw back in horror
when he encounters &#8220;dualism,&#8221; or feel an increased
satisfaction when he falls in with &#8220;monotheism&#8221;;
he must not feel awe when he
pronounces the name of Yahweh and contempt
when he utters the name of Zeus; he must not
picture a satyr when he reads the word &#8220;d&aelig;mon,&#8221;
and imagine a winged dream of beauty when he
pronounces the word &#8220;angel.&#8221; For him heresy
and orthodoxy must not exist; he sees only his
own soul slowly working out its own experience,
looking at life from every possible view-point,
so that haply at last he may see the whole, and
having seen the whole, may become at one with
God.</p>

<p>To Apollonius the mere fashion of a man&#8217;s faith
was unessential; he was at home in all lands,
among all cults. He had a helpful word for all,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
an intimate knowledge of the particular way of
each of them, which enabled him to restore them
to health. Such men are rare; the records of
such men are precious, and require the embellishments
of no rhetorician.</p>

<p>Let us then, first of all, try to recover the outline
of the early external life and of the travels
of Apollonius shorn of Philostratus&#8217; embellishments,
and then endeavour to consider the nature
of his mission, the manner of the philosophy
which he so dearly loved and which was to him
his religion, and last, if possible, the way of his
inner life.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section VII.</span></h4>

<h3>EARLY LIFE.</h3>

<p>Apollonius was born<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> at Tyana, a city in the
south of Cappadocia, somewhen in the early
years of the Christian era. His parents were
of ancient family and considerable fortune (i. 4).
At an early age he gave signs of a very powerful
memory and studious disposition, and was
remarkable for his beauty. At the age of fourteen
he was sent to Tarsus, a famous centre of
learning of the time, to complete his studies.
But mere rhetoric and style and the life of the
&#8220;schools&#8221; were little suited to his serious disposition,
and he speedily left for &AElig;g&aelig;, a town on the
sea-coast east of Tarsus. Here he found surroundings
more suitable to his needs, and plunged with
ardour into the study of philosophy. He became
intimate with the priests of the temple of
&AElig;sculapius, where cures were still wrought, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>enjoyed the society and instruction of pupils
and teachers of the Platonic, Stoic, Peripatetic,
and Epicurean schools of philosophy; but though
he studied all these systems of thought with
attention, it was the lessons of the Pythagorean
school upon which he seized with an extraordinary
depth of comprehension,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> and that, too, although
his teacher, Euxenus, was but a parrot of the
doctrines and not a practiser of the discipline.
But such parrotting was not enough for the eager
spirit of Apollonius; his extraordinary &#8220;memory,&#8221;
which infused life into the dull utterances of his
tutor, urged him on, and at the age of sixteen
&#8220;he soared into the Pythagorean life, winged by
some greater one.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> Nevertheless he retained
his affection for the man who had told him of
the way, and rewarded him handsomely (i. 7).</p>

<p>When Euxenus asked him how he would begin
his new mode of life he replied: &#8220;As doctors
purge their patients.&#8221; Hence he refused to touch
anything that had animal life in it, on the ground
that it densified the mind and rendered it impure.
He considered that the only pure form of food
was what the earth produced, fruits and vegetables.
He also abstained from wine, for though
it was made from fruit, &#8220;it rendered turbid the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>&aelig;ther<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> in the soul&#8221; and &#8220;destroyed the composure
of the mind.&#8221; Moreover, he went
barefoot, let his hair grow long, and wore
nothing but linen. He now lived in the temple,
to the admiration of the priests and with the
express approval of &AElig;sculapius,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> and he rapidly
became so famous for his asceticism and pious
life, that a saying<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> of the Cilicians about him
became a proverb (i. 8).</p>

<p>At the age of twenty his father died (his
mother having died some years before) leaving a
considerable fortune, which Apollonius was to
share with his elder brother, a wild and dissolute
youth of twenty-three. Being still a minor,
Apollonius continued to reside at &AElig;g&aelig;, where
the temple of &AElig;sculapius had now become a
busy centre of study, and echoed from one end to
the other with the sound of lofty philosophical
discourses. On coming of age he returned to
Tyana to endeavour to rescue his brother from
his vicious life. His brother had apparently
exhausted his legal share of the property, and
Apollonius at once made over half of his own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>portion to him, and by his gentle admonitions
restored him to his manhood. In fact he seems
to have devoted his time to setting in order the
affairs of the family, for he distributed the rest
of his patrimony among certain of his relatives,
and kept for himself but a bare pittance; he
required but little, he said, and should never
marry (i. 13).</p>

<p>He now took the vow of silence for five years,
for he was determined not to write on philosophy
until he had passed through this wholesome
discipline. These five years were passed mostly
in Pamphylia and Cilicia, and though he spent
much time in study, he did not immure himself in
a community or monastery but kept moving about
and travelling from city to city. The temptations
to break his self-imposed vow were enormous.
His strange appearance drew everyone&#8217;s attention,
the laughter-loving populace made the silent
philosopher the butt of their unscrupulous wit,
and all the protection he had against their
scurrility and misconceptions was the dignity
of his mien and the glance of eyes that now
could see both past and future. Many a time
he was on the verge of bursting out against
some exceptional insult or lying gossip, but ever
he restrained himself with the words: &#8220;Heart,
patient be, and thou, my tongue, be still&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> (i. 14).</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>
<p>Yet even this stern repression of the common
mode of speech did not prevent his good doing.
Even at this early age he had begun to correct
abuses. With eyes and hands and motions of
the head, he made his meaning understood, and
on one occasion, at Aspendus in Pamphylia,
prevented a serious corn riot by silencing the
crowd with his commanding gestures and then
writing what he had to say on his tablets (i. 15).</p>

<p>So far, apparently, Philostratus has been dependent
upon the account of Maximus of &AElig;g&aelig;,
or perhaps only up to the time of Apollonius&#8217;
quitting &AElig;g&aelig;. There is now a considerable
gap in the narrative, and two short chapters
of vague generalities (i. 16, 17) are all that
Philostratus can produce as the record of some
fifteen or twenty<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> years, until Damis&#8217; notes
begin.</p>

<p>After the five years of silence, we find Apollonius
at Antioch, but this seems to be only an
incident in a long round of travel and work,
and it is probable that Philostratus brings
Antioch into prominence merely because what
little he had learnt of this period of Apollonius&#8217;
life, he picked up in this much-frequented city.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>
<p>Even from Philostratus himself we learn incidentally
later on (i. 20; iv. 38) that Apollonius
had spent some time among the Arabians, and
had been instructed by them. And by Arabia
we are to understand the country south of
Palestine, which was at this period a regular
hot-bed of mystic communities. The spots he
visited were in out-of-the-way places, where
the spirit of holiness lingered, and not the
crowded and disturbed cities, for the subject
of his conversation, he said, required &#8220;<i>men</i> and
not people.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> He spent his time in travelling
from one to another of these temples, shrines,
and communities; from which we may conclude
that there was some kind of a common freemasonry,
as it were, among them, of the nature
of initiation, which opened the door of hospitality
to him.</p>

<p>But wherever he went, he always held to a
certain regular division of the day. At sun-rise
he practised certain religious exercises alone, the
nature of which he communicated only to those
who had passed through the discipline of a &#8220;four
years&#8217;&#8221; (? five years&#8217;) silence. He then conversed
with the temple priests or the heads of
the community, according as he was staying in
a Greek or non-Greek temple with public rites,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>or in a community with a discipline peculiar to
itself apart from the public cult.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>He thus endeavoured to bring back the
public cults to the purity of their ancient
traditions, and to suggest improvements in the
practices of the private brotherhoods. The most
important part of his work was with those who
were following the inner life, and who already
looked upon Apollonius as a teacher of the hidden
way. To these his comrades (&#7953;&#964;&#945;&#8055;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#962;) and
pupils (&#8001;&#956;&#953;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#8049;&#962;), he devoted much attention,
being ever ready to answer their questions and
give advice and instruction. Not however
that he neglected the people; it was his invariable
custom to teach them, but always after mid-day;
for those who lived the inner life,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> he said,
should on day&#8217;s dawning enter the presence of
the Gods,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> then spend the time till mid-day in
giving and receiving instruction in holy things,
and not till after noon devote themselves to
human affairs. That is to say, the morning was
devoted by Apollonius to the divine science,
and the afternoon to instruction in ethics and
practical life. After the day&#8217;s work he bathed
in cold water, as did so many of the mystics of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>the time in those lands, notably the Essenes
and Therapeuts (i. 16).</p>

<p>&#8220;After these things,&#8221; says Philostratus, as
vaguely as the writer of a gospel narrative,
Apollonius determined to visit the Brachmanes
and Sarmanes.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> What induced our philosopher
to make so long and dangerous a journey
nowhere appears from Philostratus, who simply
says that Apollonius thought it a good thing
for a young man<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> to travel. It is abundantly
evident, however, that Apollonius never travelled
merely for the sake of travelling. What he does
he does with a distinct purpose. And his guides
on this occasion, as he assures his disciples who
tried to dissuade him from his endeavour and
refused to accompany him, were wisdom and his
inner monitor (d&aelig;mon). &#8220;Since ye are faint-hearted,&#8221;
says the solitary pilgrim, &#8220;I bid you
farewell. As for myself I must go whithersoever
wisdom and my inner self may lead me. The
Gods are my advisers and I can but rely on their
counsels&#8221; (i. 18).</p>

<h3>THE TRAVELS OF APOLLONIUS.</h3>

<p>And so Apollonius departs from Antioch and
journeys on to Ninus, the relic of the once great
Nina or Nineveh. There he meets with Damis,
who becomes his constant companion and faithful
disciple. &#8220;Let us go together,&#8221; says Damis in
words reminding us somewhat of the words of
Ruth. &#8220;Thou shalt follow God, and I thee!&#8221;
(i. 19).</p>

<p>From this point Philostratus professes to base
himself to a great extent on the narrative of
Damis, and before going further, it is necessary
to try to form some estimate of the character of
Damis, and discover how far he was admitted to
the real confidence of Apollonius.</p>

<p>Damis was an enthusiast who loved Apollonius
with a passionate affection. He saw in his
master almost a divine being, possessed of
marvellous powers at which he continually
wondered, but which he could never understand.
Like &#256;nanda, the favourite disciple of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Buddha and his constant companion, Damis
advanced but slowly in comprehension of the
real nature of spiritual science; he had ever to
remain in the outer courts of the temples and
communities into whose shrines and inner
confidence Apollonius had full access, while he
frequently states his ignorance of his master&#8217;s
plans and purposes.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> The additional fact that
he refers to his notes as the &#8220;crumbs&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> from
the &#8220;feasts of the Gods&#8221; (i. 19), those feasts of
which he could for the most part only learn at
secondhand what little Apollonius thought fit
to tell him, and which he doubtless largely misunderstood
and clothed in his own imaginings,
would further confirm this view, if any further
confirmation were necessary. But indeed it is
very manifest everywhere that Damis was outside
the circle of initiation, and this accounts both
for his wonder-loving point of view and his
general superficiality.</p>

<p>Another fact that comes out prominently from
the narrative is his timid nature.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> He is continually
afraid for himself or for his master;
and even towards the end, when Apollonius
is imprisoned by Domitian, it requires the
phenomenal removal of the fetters before his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>eyes to assure him that Apollonius is a willing
victim.</p>

<p>Damis loves and wonders; seizes on unimportant
detail and exaggerates it, while he can
only report of the really important things what
he fancies to have taken place from a few hints of
Apollonius. As his story advances, it is true it
takes on a soberer tint; but what Damis omits,
Philostratus is ever ready to supply from his
own store of marvels, if chance offers.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even were we with the scalpel
of criticism to cut away every morsel of flesh
from this body of tradition and legend, there
would still remain a skeleton of fact that would
still represent Apollonius and give us some idea
of his stature.</p>

<p>Apollonius was one of the greatest travellers
known to antiquity. Among the countries and
places he visited the following are the chief
ones recorded by Philostratus.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>From Ninus (i. 19) Apollonius journeys to
Babylon (i. 21), where he stops one year and
eight months (i. 40) and visits surrounding cities
such as Ecbatana, the capital of Media (i. 39);
from Babylon to the Indian frontier no names
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>are mentioned; India was entered in every
probability by the Khaibar Pass (ii. 6),<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> for the
first city mentioned is Taxila (Attock) (ii. 20);
and so they make their way across the tributaries
of the Indus (ii. 43) to the valley of the Ganges
(iii. 5), and finally arrive at the &#8220;monastery of
the wise men&#8221; (iii. 10), where Apollonius spends
four months (iii. 50).</p>

<p>This monastery was presumably in Nep&#257;l; it is
in the mountains, and the &#8220;city&#8221; nearest it is
called Paraca. The chaos that Philostratus has
made of Damis&#8217; account, and before him the
wonderful transformations Damis himself wrought
in Indian names, are presumably shown in this
word. Paraca is perchance all that Damis could
make of Bharata, the general name of the Ganges
valley in which the dominant &#256;ryas were settled.
It is also probable that these wise men were
Buddhists, for they dwelt in a &#964;&#8059;&#961;&#963;&#953;&#962;, a place that
looked like a fort or fortress to Damis.</p>

<p>I have little doubt that Philostratus could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>make nothing out of the geography of India
from the names in Damis&#8217; diary; they were all
unfamiliar to him, so that as soon as he has
exhausted the few Greek names known to him
from the accounts of the expedition of Alexander,
he wanders in the &#8220;ends of the earth,&#8221; and can
make nothing of it till he picks up our travellers
again on their return journey at the mouth of
the Indus. The salient fact that Apollonius was
making for a certain community, which was his
peculiar goal, so impressed the imagination of
Philostratus (and perhaps of Damis before him)
that he has described it as being the only centre
of the kind in India. Apollonius went to India
with a purpose and returned from it with a
distinct mission;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> and perchance his constant
inquiries concerning the particular &#8220;wise men&#8221;
whom he was seeking, led Damis to imagine that
they alone were the &#8220;Gymnosophists,&#8221; the
&#8220;naked philosophers&#8221; (if we are to take the
term in its literal sense) of popular Greek legend,
which ignorantly ascribed to all the Hindu
ascetics the most striking peculiarity of a very
small number. But to return to our itinerary.</p>

<p>Philostratus embellishes the account of the
voyage from the Indus to the mouth of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>Euphrates (iii. 52-58) with the travellers&#8217; tales
and names of islands and cities he has gleaned
from the Indica which were accessible to him,
and so we again return to Babylon and familiar
geography with the following itinerary:</p>

<p>Babylon, Ninus, Antioch, Seleucia, Cyprus;
thence to Ionia (iii. 58), where he spends some
time in Asia Minor, especially at Ephesus (iv. 1),
Smyrna (iv. 5), Pergamus (iv. 9), and Troy
(iv. 11). Thence Apollonius crosses over to
Lesbos (iv. 13), and subsequently sails for Athens,
where he spends some years in Greece (iv. 17-33)
visiting the temples of Hellas, reforming their
rites and instructing the priests (iv. 24). We
next find him in Crete (iv. 34), and subsequently
at Rome in the time of Nero (iv. 36-46).</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 66 Nero issued a decree forbidding any
philosopher to remain in Rome, and Apollonius
set out for Spain, and landed at Gades, the
modern Cadiz; he seems to have stayed in Spain
only a short time (iv. 47); thence crossed to
Africa, and so by sea once more to Sicily, where
the principal cities and temples were visited
(v. 11-14). Thence Apollonius returned to
Greece (v. 18), four years having elapsed since
his landing at Athens from Lesbos (v. 19).<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>
<p>From Pir&aelig;us our philosopher sails for Chios
(v. 21), thence to Rhodes, and so to Alexandria
(v. 24). At Alexandria he spends some time,
and has several interviews with the future
Emperor Vespasian (v. 27-41), and thence he
sets out on a long journey up the Nile as far as
Ethiopia beyond the cataracts, where he visits
an interesting community of ascetics called
loosely Gymnosophists (vi. 1-27).</p>

<p>On his return to Alexandria (vi. 28), he was
summoned by Titus, who had just become
emperor, to meet him at Tarsus (vi. 29-34).
After this interview he appears to have returned
to Egypt, for Philostratus speaks vaguely of
his spending some time in Lower Egypt, and
of visits to the Ph&oelig;nicians, Cilicians, Ionians,
Ach&aelig;ans, and also to Italy (vi. 35).</p>

<p>Now Vespasian was emperor from 69 to 79,
and Titus from 79 to 81. As Apollonius&#8217;
interviews with Vespasian took place shortly
before the beginning of that emperor&#8217;s reign, it
is reasonable to conclude that a number of years
was spent by our philosopher in his Ethiopian
journey, and that therefore Damis&#8217; account is a
most imperfect one. In 81 Domitian became
emperor, and just as Apollonius opposed the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>follies of Nero, so did he criticise the acts of
Domitian. He accordingly became an object of
suspicion to the emperor; but instead of keeping
away from Rome, he determined to brave the
tyrant to his face. Crossing from Egypt to
Greece and taking ship at Corinth, he sailed by
way of Sicily to Puteoli, and thence to the Tiber
mouth, and so to Rome (vii. 10-16). Here
Apollonius was tried and acquitted (vii. 17&mdash;viii.
10). Sailing from Puteoli again Apollonius
returned to Greece (viii. 15), where he spent
two years (viii. 24). Thence once more he
crossed over to Ionia at the time of the death
of Domitian (viii. 25), visiting Smyrna and
Ephesus and other of his favourite haunts.
Hereupon he sends away Damis on some pretext
to Rome (viii. 28) and&mdash;disappears; that is to
say, if it be allowed to speculate, he undertook
yet another journey to the place which he loved
above all others, the &#8220;home of the wise men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Domitian was killed 96 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and one of
the last recorded acts of Apollonius is his vision
of this event at the time of its occurrence.
Therefore the trial of Apollonius at Rome took
place somewhere about 93, and we have a gap
of twelve years from his interview with Titus in
81, which Philostratus can only fill up with a
few vague stories and generalities.</p>

<p>As to his age at the time of his mysterious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
disappearance from the pages of history, Philostratus
tells us that Damis says nothing; but
some, he adds, say he was eighty, some ninety,
and some even an hundred.</p>

<p>The estimate of eighty years seems to fit in
best with the rest of the chronological indications,
but there is no certainty in the matter with the
present materials at our disposal.</p>

<p>Such then is the geographical outline, so to say,
of the life of Apollonius, and even the most careless
reader of the bare skeleton of the journeys
recorded by Philostratus must be struck by the
indomitable energy of the man, and his power of
endurance.</p>

<p>We will now turn our attention to one or two
points of interest connected with the temples
and communities he visited.</p>

<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section IX.</span></h4>

<h3>IN THE SHRINES OF THE TEMPLES AND
THE RETREATS OF RELIGION.</h3>

<p>Seeing that the nature of Apollonius&#8217; business
with the priests of the temples and the devotees
of the mystic life was necessarily of a most
intimate and secret nature, for in those days it
was the invariable custom to draw a sharp line
of demarcation between the inner and outer,
the initiated and the profane, it is not to be
expected that we can learn anything but mere
externalities from the Damis-Philostratus
narrative; nevertheless, even these outer indications
are of interest.</p>

<p>The temple of &AElig;sculapius at &AElig;g&aelig;, where
Apollonius spent the most impressionable years
of his life, was one of the innumerable hospitals
of Greece, where the healing art was practised
on lines totally different to our present methods.
We are at once introduced to an atmosphere
laden with psychic influences, to a centre whither
for centuries patients had flocked to &#8220;consult<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the God.&#8221; In order to do so, it was necessary
for them to go through certain preliminary
purifications and follow certain rules given by
the priests; they then passed the night in the
shrine and in their sleep instructions were given
them for their healing. This method, no doubt,
was only resorted to when the skill of the priest
was exhausted; in any case, the priests must have
been deeply versed in the interpretation of these
dreams and in their rationale. It is also evident
that as Apollonius loved to pass his time in the
temple, he must have found there satisfaction
for his spiritual needs, and instruction in the inner
science; though doubtless his own innate powers
soon carried him beyond his instructors and
marked him out as the &#8220;favourite of the God.&#8221;
The many cases on record in our own day of
patients in trance or some other psychic condition
prescribing for themselves, will help the
student to understand the innumerable possibilities
of healing which were in Greece summed up
in the personification &AElig;sculapius.</p>

<p>Later on the chief of the Indian sages has a
disquisition on &AElig;sculapius and the healing art
put into his mouth (iii. 44), where the whole of
medicine is said to be dependent upon psychic
diagnosis and prescience (&#956;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#8055;&#945;).</p>

<p>Finally it may be noticed that it was the invariable
custom of patients on their recovery to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
record the fact on an <i>ex-voto</i> tablet in the temple,
precisely as is done to-day in Roman Catholic
countries.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>On his way to India Apollonius saw a good
deal of the Magi at Babylon. He used to visit
them at mid-day and mid-night, but of what
transpired Damis knew nothing, for Apollonius
would not permit him to accompany him, and in
answer to his direct questions would only answer:
&#8220;They are wise, but not in all things&#8221; (i. 26).</p>

<p>The description of a certain hall, however, to
which Apollonius had access, seems to be a
garbled version of the interior of the temple.
The roof was dome-shaped, and the ceiling was
covered with &#8220;sapphire&#8221;; in this blue heaven
were models of the heavenly bodies (&#8220;those
whom they regard as Gods&#8221;) fashioned in gold,
as though moving in the ether. Moreover from
the roof were suspended four golden &#8220;Iygges&#8221;
which the Magi call the &#8220;Tongues of the Gods.&#8221;
These were winged-wheels or spheres connected
with the idea of Adrasteia (or Fate). Their
prototypes are described imperfectly in the
Vision of Ezekiel, and the so-called Hecatine
<i>strophali</i> or <i>spherul&aelig;</i> used in magical practices
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>may have been degenerate descendants of these
&#8220;living wheels&#8221; or spheres of the vital elements.
The subject is one of intense interest, but
hopelessly incapable of treatment in our present
age of scepticism and profound ignorance of the
past. The &#8220;Gods&#8221; who taught our infant
humanity were, according to occult tradition, from
a humanity higher than that at present evolving
on our earth. They gave the impulse, and,
when the earth-children were old enough to
stand on their own feet, they withdrew. But
the memory of their deeds and a corrupt and
degenerate form of the mysteries they established
has ever lingered in the memory of myth and
legend. Seers have caught obscure glimpses of
what they taught and how they taught it, and
the tradition of the Mysteries preserved some
memory of it in its symbols and instruments or
engines. The Iygges of the Magi are said to be
a relic of this memory.</p>

<p>With regard to the Indian sages it is impossible
to make out any consistent story from the
fantastic jumble of the Damis-Philostratus
romance. Damis seems to have confused together
a mixture of memories and scraps of
gossip without any attempt to distinguish one
community or sect from another, and so produced
a blurred daub which Philostratus would have us
regard as a picture of the &#8220;hill&#8221; and a descrip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>tion
of its &#8220;sages.&#8221; Damis&#8217; confused memories,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>
however, have little to do with the actual
monastery and its ascetic inhabitants, who were
the goal of Apollonius&#8217; long journey. What
Apollonius heard and saw there, following his
invariable custom in such circumstances, he told
no one, not even Damis, except what could be
derived from the following enigmatical sentence:
&#8220;I saw men dwelling on the earth and yet not
on it, defended on all sides, yet without any
defence, and yet possessed of nothing but what
all possess.&#8221; These words occur in two passages
(iii. 15 and vi. 11), and in both Philostratus
adds that Apollonius wrote<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> and spoke them
enigmatically. The meaning of this saying is
not difficult to divine. They were on the earth,
but not of the earth, for their minds were set
on things above. They were protected by their
innate spiritual power, of which we have so
many instances in Indian literature; and yet
they possessed nothing but what all men possess
if they would but develop the spiritual part of
their being. But this explanation is not simple
enough for Philostratus, and so he presses into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>service all the memories of Damis, or rather
travellers&#8217; tales, about levitation, magical
illusions and the rest.</p>

<p>The head of the community is called Iarchas,
a totally un-Indian name. The violence done to
all foreign names by the Greeks is notorious, and
here we have to reckon with an army of ignorant
copyists as well as with Philostratus and Damis.
I would suggest that the name may perhaps be a
corruption of Arhat.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>The main burden of Damis&#8217; narrative insists
on the psychic and spiritual knowledge of the
sages. They know what takes place at a distance,
they can tell the past and future, and
read the past births of men.</p>

<p>The messenger sent to meet Apollonius carried
what Damis calls a golden anchor (iii. 11, 17),
and if this is an authentic fact, it would suggest
a forerunner of the Tibetan <i>dorje</i>, the present
degenerate symbol of the &#8220;rod of power,&#8221; something
like the thunder-bolt wielded by Zeus.
This would also point to a Buddhist community,
though it must be confessed that other indications
point equally strongly to Br&#257;hmanical customs,
such as the caste-mark on the forehead of the
messenger (iii. 7, 11), the carrying of (bamboo)
staves (da&#7751;&#7693;a), letting the hair grow long, and
wearing of turbans (iii. 13). But indeed the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>whole account is too confused to permit any
hope of extracting historical details.</p>

<p>Of the nature of Apollonius&#8217; visit we may,
however, judge from the following mysterious
letter to his hosts (iii. 51):</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to you by land and ye have given me
the sea; nay, rather, by sharing with me your wisdom
ye have given me power to travel through
heaven. These things will I bring back to the
mind of the Greeks, and I will hold converse
with you as though ye were present, if it be
that I have not drunk of the cup of Tantalus in
vain.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is evident from these cryptic sentences that
the &#8220;sea&#8221; and the &#8220;cup of Tantalus&#8221; are identical
with the &#8220;wisdom&#8221; which had been imparted
to Apollonius&mdash;the wisdom which he was to
bring back once more to the memory of the
Greeks. He thus clearly states that he returned
from India with a distinct mission and with the
means to accomplish it, for not only had he drunk
of the ocean of wisdom in that he has learnt the
Brahm&#257;-vidy&#257; from their lips, but he has also
learnt how to converse with them though his
body be in Greece and their bodies in India.</p>

<p>But such a plain meaning&mdash;plain at least to
every student of occult nature&mdash;was beyond the
understanding of Damis or the comprehension
of Philostratus. And it is doubtless the mention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
of the &#8220;cup of Tantalus&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> in this letter which
suggested the inexhaustible loving cup episode
in iii. 32, and its connection with the mythical
fountains of Bacchus. Damis presses it into
service to &#8220;explain&#8221; the last phrase in Apollonius&#8217;
saying about the sages, namely, that they were
&#8220;possessed of nothing but what all possess&#8221;&mdash;which,
however, appears elsewhere in a changed
form, as &#8220;possessing nothing, they have the
possessions of all men&#8221; (iii. 15).<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>On returning to Greece, one of the first shrines
Apollonius visited was that of Aphrodite at
Paphos in Cyprus (iii. 58). The greatest external
peculiarity of the Paphian worship of
Venus was the representation of the goddess by
a mysterious stone symbol. It seems to have
been of the size of a human being, but shaped
like a pine-cone, only of course with a smooth
surface. Paphos was apparently the oldest shrine
dedicated to Venus in Greece. Its mysteries
were very ancient, but not indigenous; they were
brought over from the mainland, from what was
subsequently Cilicia, in times of remote antiquity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p><p>The worship or consultation of the Goddess was
by means of prayers and the &#8220;pure flame of
fire,&#8221; and the temple was a great centre of
divination.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<p>Apollonius spent some time here and instructed
the priests at length with regard to their sacred
rites.</p>

<p>In Asia Minor he was especially pleased with
the temple of &AElig;sculapius at Pergamus; he healed
many of the patients there, and gave instruction
in the proper methods to adopt in order to procure
reliable results by means of the prescriptive
dreams.</p>

<p>At Troy, we are told, Apollonius spent a night
alone at the tomb of Achilles, in former days
one of the spots of greatest popular sanctity in
Greece (iv. 11). Why he did so does not transpire,
for the fantastic conversation with the
shade of the hero reported by Philostratus
(iv. 16) seems to be devoid of any element of
likelihood. As, however, Apollonius made it
his business to visit Thessaly shortly afterwards
expressly to urge the Thessalians to renew the
old accustomed rites to the hero (iv. 13), we may
suppose that it formed part of his great effort to
restore and purify the old institutions of Hellas,
so that, the accustomed channels being freed, the
life might flow more healthily in the national body.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>
<p>Rumour would also have it that Achilles had
told Apollonius where he would find the statue
of the hero Palamedes on the coast of &AElig;olia.
Apollonius accordingly restored the statue, and
Philostratus tells us he had seen it with his
own eyes on the spot (iv. 13).</p>

<p>Now this would be a matter of very little
interest, were it not that a great deal is made
of Palamedes elsewhere in Philostratus&#8217; narrative.
What it all means is difficult to say with a Damis
and Philostratus as interpreters between ourselves
and the silent and enigmatical Apollonius.</p>

<p>Palamedes was one of the heroes before Troy,
who was fabled to have invented letters, or to
have completed the alphabet of Cadmus.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>Now from two obscure sayings (iv. 13, 33),
we glean that our philosopher looked upon
Palamedes as the philosopher-hero of the Trojan
period, although Homer says hardly a word
about him.</p>

<p>Was this, then, the reason why Apollonius
was so anxious to restore his statue? Not
altogether so; there appears to have been a
more direct reason. Damis would have it that
Apollonius had met Palamedes in India; that
he was at the monastery; that Iarchas had one
day pointed out a young ascetic who could
&#8220;write without ever learning letters&#8221;; and that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>this youth had been no other than Palamedes in
one of his former births. Doubtless the sceptic
will say: &#8220;Of course! Pythagoras was a reincarnation
of the hero Euphorbus who fought
at Troy, according to popular superstition;
therefore, naturally, the young Indian was the
reincarnation of the hero Palamedes! The one
legend simply begat the other.&#8221; But on this
principle, to be consistent, we should expect to
find that it was Apollonius himself and not
an unknown Hindu ascetic, who had been once
Palamedes.</p>

<p>In any case Apollonius restored the rites to
Achilles, and erected a chapel in which he set up
the neglected statue of Palamedes.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> The heroes
of the Trojan period, then, it would seem, had
still some connection with Greece, according to
the science of the invisible world into which
Apollonius was initiated. And if the Protestant
sceptic can make nothing of it, at least the
Roman Catholic reader may be induced to
suspend his judgment by changing &#8220;hero&#8221; into
&#8220;saint.&#8221;</p>

<p>Can it be possible that the attention which
Apollonius bestowed upon the graves and funeral
monuments of the mighty dead of Greece may
have been inspired by the circle of ideas which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>led to the erection of the innumerable d&#257;gobas
and st&#363;pas in Buddhist lands, originally over the
relics of the Buddha, and the subsequent preservation
of relics of arhats and great teachers?</p>

<p>At Lesbos Apollonius visited the ancient
temple of the Orphic mysteries, which in early
years had been a great centre of prophecy and
divination. Here also he was privileged to
enter the inner shrine or adytum (iv. 14).</p>

<p>The Tyanean arrived in Athens at the time
of the Eleusinian Mysteries, and in spite of the
festival and rites not only the people but also
the candidates flocked to meet him to the
neglect of their religious duties. Apollonius
rebuked them, and himself joined in the necessary
preliminary rites and presented himself for initiation.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, surprise the reader to hear
that Apollonius, who had already been initiated
into higher privileges than Eleusis could afford,
should present himself for initiation. But the
reason is not far to seek; the Eleusinia constituted
one of the intermediate organisations
between the popular cults and the genuine
inner circles of instruction. They preserved
one of the traditions of the inner way, even if
their officers for the time being had forgotten
what their predecessors had once known. To
restore these ancient rites to their purity, or to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
utilise them for their original object, it was
necessary to enter within the precincts of the
institution; nothing could be effected from
outside. The thing itself was good, and Apollonius
desired to support the ancient institution
by setting the public example of seeking
initiation therein; not that he had anything to
gain personally.</p>

<p>But whether it was that the hierophant of
that time was only ignorant, or whether he was
jealous of the great influence of Apollonius, he
refused to admit our philosopher, on the ground
that he was a sorcerer (&#947;&#8057;&#951;&#962;), and that no one
could be initiated who was tainted by intercourse
with evil entities (&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#8057;&#957;&#953;&#945;). To this
charge Apollonius replied with veiled irony:
&#8220;You have omitted the most serious charge
that might have been urged against me: to wit,
that though I really know more about the mystic
rite than its hierophant, I have come here pretending
to desire initiation from men knowing
more than myself.&#8221; This charge would have
been true; he had made a pretence.</p>

<p>Dismayed at these words, frightened at the
indignation of the people aroused by the insult
offered to their distinguished guest, and overawed
by the presence of a knowledge which he could
no longer deny, the hierophant begged our
philosopher to accept the initiation. But Apol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>lonius
refused. &#8220;I will be initiated later on,&#8221;
he replied; &#8220;<i>he</i> will initiate me.&#8221; This is said
to have referred to the succeeding hierophant,
who presided when Apollonius was initiated four
years later (iv. 18; v. 19).</p>

<p>While at Athens Apollonius spoke strongly
against the effeminacy of the Bacchanalia and
the barbarities of the gladiatorial combats (iv.
21, 22).</p>

<p>The temples, mentioned by Philostratus,
which Apollonius visited in Greece, have all the
peculiarity of being very ancient; for instance,
Dodona, Delphi, the ancient shrine of Apollo at
Ab&aelig; in Phocis, the &#8220;caves&#8221; of Amphiaraus<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> and
Trophonius, and the temple of the Muses on
Helicon.</p>

<p>When he entered the adyta of these temples
for the purpose of &#8220;restoring&#8221; the rites, he was
accompanied only by the priests, and certain
of his immediate disciples (&#947;&#957;&#8061;&#961;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#953;). This
suggests an extension to the meaning of the
word &#8220;restoring&#8221; or &#8220;reforming,&#8221; and when we
read elsewhere of the many spots consecrated by
Apollonius, we cannot but think that part of his
work was the reconsecration, and hence psychic
purification, of many of these ancient centres.
His main external work, however, was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>giving of instruction, and, as Philostratus rhetorically
phrases it, &#8220;bowls of his words were
set up everywhere for the thirsty to drink from&#8221;
(iv. 24).</p>

<p>But not only did our philosopher restore the
ancient rites of religion, he also paid much
attention to the ancient polities and institutions.
Thus we find him urging with success the
Spartans to return to their ancient mode of life,
their athletic exercises, frugal living, and the
discipline of the old Dorian tradition (iv. 27,
31-34); he, moreover, specially praised the
institution of the Olympic Games, the high
standard of which was still maintained (iv. 29),
while he recalled the ancient Amphictionic
Council to its duty (iv. 23), and corrected the
abuses of the Panionian assembly (iv. 5).</p>

<p>In the spring of 66 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> he left Greece for
Crete, where he seems to have bestowed most
of his time on the sanctuaries of Mount Ida and
the temple of &AElig;sculapius at Lebene (&#8220;for as all
Asia visits Pergamus so does all Crete visit
Lebene&#8221;); but curiously enough he refused to
visit the famous Labyrinth at Gnossus, the
ruins of which have just been uncovered for a
sceptical generation, most probably (if it is
lawful to speculate) because it had once been
a centre of human sacrifice, and thus pertained
to one of the ancient cults of the left hand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
In Rome Apollonius continued his work of
reforming the temples, and this with the full
sanction of the Pontifex Maximus Telesinus,
one of the consuls for the year 66 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, who
was also a philosopher and a deep student of
religion (iv. 40). But his stay in the imperial
city was speedily cut short, for in October Nero
crowned his persecution of the philosophers by
publishing a decree of banishment against them
from Rome, and both Telesinus (vii. 11) and
Apollonius had to leave Italy.</p>

<p>We next find him in Spain, making his headquarters
in the temple of Hercules at Cadiz.</p>

<p>On his return to Greece by way of Africa
and Sicily (where he spent some time and
visited &AElig;tna), he passed the winter (? of 67 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>)
at Eleusis, living in the temple, and in the
spring of the following year sailed for Alexandria,
spending some time on the way at Rhodes.
The city of philosophy and eclecticism <i>par
excellence</i> received him with open arms as an
old friend. But to reform the public cults of
Egypt was a far more difficult task than any
he had previously attempted. His presence in
the temple (? the temple of Serapis) commanded
universal respect, everything about him and
every word he uttered seemed to breathe an
atmosphere of wisdom and of &#8220;something divine.&#8221;
The high priest of the temple looked on in proud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
disdain. &#8220;Who is wise enough,&#8221; he mockingly
asked, &#8220;to reform the religion of the Egyptians?&#8221;&mdash;only
to be met with the confident
retort of Apollonius: &#8220;Any sage who comes
from the Indians.&#8221; Here as elsewhere Apollonius
set his face against blood-sacrifice, and tried to
substitute instead, as he had attempted elsewhere,
the offering of frankincense modelled in
the form of the victim (v. 25). Many abuses
he tried to reform in the manners of the
Alexandrians, but upon none was he more severe
than on their wild excitement over horse-racing,
which frequently led to bloodshed (v. 26).</p>

<p>Apollonius seems to have spent most of the
remaining twenty years of his life in Egypt,
but of what he did in the secret shrines of that
land of mystery we can learn nothing from
Philostratus, except that on the protracted
journey to Ethiopia up the Nile no city or
temple or community was unvisited, and everywhere
there was an interchange of advice and
instruction in sacred things (v. 43).</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section X.</span></h4>

<h3>THE GYMNOSOPHISTS OF UPPER EGYPT.</h3>

<p>We now come to Apollonius&#8217; visit to the
&#8220;Gymnosophists&#8221; in &#8220;Ethiopia,&#8221; which, though
the artistic and literary goal of Apollonius&#8217;
journey in Egypt as elaborated by Philostratus,
is only a single incident in the real history of the
unrecorded life of our mysterious philosopher
in that ancient land.</p>

<p>Had Philostratus devoted a chapter or two
to the nature of the practices, discipline, and
doctrines of the innumerable ascetic and mystic
communities that honeycombed Egypt and
adjacent lands in those days, he would have
earned the boundless gratitude of students of
the origins. But of all this he has no word;
and yet he would have us believe that Damis&#8217;
reminiscences were an orderly series of notes
of what actually happened. But in all things
it is very apparent that Damis was rather a
<i>compagnon de voyage</i> than an initiated pupil.</p>

<p>Who then were these mysterious &#8220;Gymnoso<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>phists,&#8221;
as they are usually called, and whence
their name? Damis calls them simply the
&#8220;Naked&#8221; (&#947;&#965;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#8055;), and it is very clear that the
term is not to be understood as merely physically
naked; indeed, neither to the Indians nor to
these ascetics of uppermost Egypt can the term
be applied with appropriateness in its purely
physical meaning, as is apparent from the
descriptions of Damis and Philostratus. A
chance sentence that falls from the lips of one
of these ascetics, in giving the story of his life,
affords us a clue to the real meaning of the
term. &#8220;At the age of fourteen,&#8221; he tells
Apollonius, &#8220;I resigned my patrimony to those
who desired such things, and <i>naked</i> I sought
the <i>Naked</i>&#8221; (vi. 16).<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<p>This is the very same diction that Philo uses
about the Therapeut communities, which he declares
were very numerous in every province of
Egypt and scattered in all lands. We are not,
however, to suppose that these communities were
all of the same nature. It is true that Philo
tries to make out that the most pious and the
chief of all of them was <i>his</i> particular community
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>on the southern shore of Lake M&#339;ris, which was
strongly Semitic if not orthodoxly Jewish; and
for Philo any community with a Jewish atmosphere
must naturally have been the best. The
peculiarity and main interest of our community,
which was at the other end of the land above
the cataracts, was that it had had some remote
connection with India.</p>

<p>The community is called a &#966;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;, in the
sense of a place for meditation, a term used by
ecclesiastical writers for a monastery, but best
known to classical students from the humorous use
made of it by Aristophanes, who in The Clouds
calls the school of Socrates, a <i>phrontist&#275;rion</i> or
&#8220;thinking shop.&#8221; The collection of <i>monasteria</i>
(&#7985;&#949;&#961;&#8049;), presumably caves, shrines, or cells,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> was
situated on a hill or rising ground not far from
the Nile. They were all separated from one
another, dotted about the hill, and ingeniously
arranged. There was hardly a tree in the place,
with the exception of a single group of palms,
under whose shade they held their general meetings
(vi. 6).</p>

<p>It is difficult to gather from the set speeches,
put into the mouths of the head of the
community and Apollonius (vi. 10-13, 18-22),
any precise details as to the mode of life of these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>ascetics, beyond the general indications of an
existence of great toil and physical hardship,
which they considered the only means of gaining
wisdom. What the nature of their cult was, if
they had one, we are not told, except that at mid-day
the Naked retired to their <i>monasteria</i> (vi. 14).</p>

<p>The whole tendency of Apollonius&#8217; arguments,
however, is to remind the community of its
Eastern origin and its former connection with
India, which it seems to have forgotten. The
communities of this particular kind in southern
Egypt and northern Ethiopia dated back presumably
some centuries, and some of them may
have been remotely Buddhist, for one of the
younger members of our community who left it
to follow Apollonius, says that he came to join
it from the enthusiastic account of the wisdom
of the Indians brought back by his father, who
had been captain of a vessel trading to the East.
It was his father who told him that these
&#8220;Ethiopians&#8221; were from India, and so he had
joined them instead of making the long and
perilous journey to the Indus itself (vi. 16).</p>

<p>If there be any truth in this story it follows
that the founders of this way of life had been
Indian ascetics, and if so they must have belonged
to the only propagandising form of Indian
religion, namely, the Buddhist.</p>

<p>After the impulse had been given, the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>munities,
which were presumably recruited from
generations of Egyptians, Arabs, and Ethiopians,
were probably left entirely to themselves, and so
in course of time forgot their origin, and even
perhaps their original rule. Such speculations
are permissible, owing to the <i>repeated</i> assertion
of the original connection between these Gymnosophists
and India. The whole burden of the
story is that they were Indians who had forgotten
their origin and fallen away from the wisdom.</p>

<p>The last incident that Philostratus records with
regard to Apollonius among the shrines and
temples is a visit to the famous and very ancient
oracle of Trophonius, near Lebadea, in B&#339;otia.
Apollonius is said to have spent seven days alone
in this mysterious &#8220;cave,&#8221; and to have returned
with a book full of questions and answers on the
subject of &#8220;philosophy&#8221; (viii. 19). This book
was still, in the time of Philostratus, in the
palace of Hadrian at Antium, together with a
number of letters of Apollonius, and many people
used to visit Antium for the special purpose of
seeing it (viii. 19, 20).</p>

<p>In the hay-bundle of legendary rigmarole
solemnly set down by Philostratus concerning the
cave of Trophonius, a small needle of truth may
perhaps be discovered. The &#8220;cave&#8221; seems to
have been a very ancient temple or shrine, cut
in the heart of a hill, to which a number of under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>ground
passages of considerable length led. It
had probably been in ancient times one of the
most holy centres of the archaic cult of Hellas,
perhaps even a relic of that Greece of thousands
of years <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the only tradition of which, as Plato
tells us, was obtained by Solon from the priests
of Sa&iuml;s. Or it may have been a subterranean
shrine of the same nature as the famous Dict&aelig;an
cave in Crete which only last year was brought
back to light by the indefatigable labours of
Messrs. Evans and Hogarth.</p>

<p>As in the case of the travels of Apollonius, so
with regard to the temples and communities
which he visited, Philostratus is a most disappointing
<i>cicerone</i>. But perhaps he is not to be
blamed on this account, for the most important
and most interesting part of Apollonius&#8217; work
was of so intimate a nature, prosecuted as it was
among associations of such jealously-guarded
secrecy, that no one outside their ranks could
know anything of it, and those who shared in
their initiation would say nothing.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, only when Apollonius comes
forward to do some public act that we can get
any precise historical trace of him; in every
other case he passes into the sanctuary of a
temple or enters the privacy of a community
and is lost to view.</p>

<p>It may perhaps surprise us that Apollonius,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
after sacrificing his private fortune, could nevertheless
undertake such long and expensive travels,
but it would seem that he was occasionally
supplied with the necessary monies from the
treasuries of the temples (<i>cf.</i> viii. 17), and that
everywhere he was freely offered the hospitality
of the temple or community in the place where
he happened to be staying.</p>

<p>In conclusion of the present part of our
subject, we may mention the good service done
by Apollonius in driving away certain Chald&aelig;an
and Egyptian charlatans who were making
capital out of the fears of the cities on the left
shores of the Hellespont. These cities had suffered
severely from shocks of earthquake, and in
their panic placed large sums of money in the
hands of these adventurers (who &#8220;trafficked in
the misfortunes of others&#8221;), in order that they
might perform propitiatory rites (vi. 41). This
taking money for the giving instruction in the
sacred science or for the performance of sacred
rites was the most detestable of crimes to all
the true philosophers.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section XI.</span></h4>

<h3>APOLLONIUS AND THE RULERS OF THE
EMPIRE.</h3>

<p>But not only did Apollonius vivify and reconsecrate
the old centres of religion for some inscrutable
reason, and do what he could to help
on the religious life of the time in its multiplex
phases, but he took a decided, though indirect,
part in influencing the destinies of the Empire
through the persons of its supreme rulers.</p>

<p>This influence, however, was invariably of a
moral and not of a political nature. It was
brought to bear by means of philosophical converse
and instruction, by word of mouth or letter.
Just as Apollonius on his travels conversed on
philosophy, and discoursed on the life of a wise
man and the duties of a wise ruler, with kings,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>
rulers, and magistrates, so he endeavoured to
advise for their good those of the emperors who
would listen to him.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>
<p>Vespasian, Titus, and Nerva were all, prior to
their elevation to the purple, friends and admirers
of Apollonius, while Nero and Domitian
regarded the philosopher with dismay.</p>

<p>During Apollonius&#8217; short stay in Rome, in
66 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, although he never let the slightest
word escape him that could be construed by the
numerous informers into a treasonable utterance,
he was nevertheless brought before Tigellinus,
the infamous favourite of Nero, and subjected to
a severe cross-examination. Apparently up to
this time Apollonius, working for the future, had
confined his attention entirely to the reformation
of religion and the restoration of the ancient
institutions of the nations, but the tyrannical
conduct of Nero, which gave peace not even
to the most blameless philosophers, at length
opened his eyes to a more immediate evil,
which seemed no less than the abrogation of the
liberty of conscience by an irresponsible tyranny.
From this time onwards, therefore, we find him
keenly interested in the persons of the successive
emperors.</p>

<p>Indeed Damis, although he confesses his entire
ignorance of the purpose of Apollonius&#8217; journey
to Spain after his expulsion from Rome, would
have it that it was to aid the forthcoming revolt
against Nero. He conjectures this from a three
days&#8217; secret interview that Apollonius had with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
the Governor of the Province of B&aelig;tica, who
came to Cadiz especially to see him, and declares
that the last words of Apollonius&#8217; visitor were:
&#8220;Farewell, and remember Vindex&#8221; (v. 10).</p>

<p>It is true that almost immediately afterwards
the revolt of Vindex, the Governor of Gaul,
broke out, but the whole life and character of
Apollonius is opposed to any idea of political
intrigue; on the contrary, he bravely withstood
tyranny and injustice to the face. He was
opposed to the idea of Euphrates, a philosopher
of quite a different stamp, who would have put
an end to the monarchy and restored the republic
(v. 33); he believed that government by
a monarch was the best for the Empire, but he
desired above all other things to see the &#8220;flock of
mankind&#8221; led by a &#8220;wise and faithful shepherd&#8221;
(v. 35).</p>

<p>So that though Apollonius supported Vespasian
as long as he worthily tried to follow out this
ideal, he immediately rebuked him to his face
when he deprived the Greek cities of their privileges.
&#8220;You have enslaved Greece,&#8221; he wrote.
&#8220;You have reduced a free people to slavery&#8221;
(v. 41). Nevertheless, in spite of this rebuke,
Vespasian in his last letter to his son Titus,
confesses that they are what they are solely
owing to the good advice of Apollonius (v.
30).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Equally so he journeyed to Rome to meet
Domitian face to face, and though he was put
on trial and every effort made to prove him
guilty of treasonable plotting with Nerva, he
could not be convicted of anything of a political
nature. Nerva was a good man, he told the
emperor, and no traitor. Not that Domitian had
really any suspicion that Apollonius was personally
plotting against him; he cast him into
prison solely in the hope that he might induce
the philosopher to disclose the confidences of
Nerva and other prominent men who were
objects of suspicion to him, and who he imagined
had consulted Apollonius on their chances of
success. Apollonius&#8217; business was not with politics,
but with the &#8220;princes who asked him for
his advice on the subject of virtue&#8221; (vi. 43).</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section XII.</span></h4>

<h3>APOLLONIUS THE PROPHET AND
WONDER-WORKER.</h3>

<p>We will now turn our attention for a brief space
to that side of Apollonius&#8217; life which has made
him the subject of invincible prejudice. Apollonius
was not only a philosopher, in the sense of
being a theoretical speculator or of being the
follower of an ordered mode of life schooled in
the discipline of resignation; he was also a
philosopher in the original Pythagorean meaning
of the term&mdash;a knower of Nature&#8217;s secrets, who
thus could speak as one having authority.</p>

<p>He knew the hidden things of Nature by sight
and not by hearing; for him the path of philosophy
was a life whereby the man himself became
an instrument of knowing. Religion, for Apollonius,
was not a faith only, it was a science.
For him the shows of things were but ever-changing
appearances; cults and rites, religions
and faiths, were all one to him, provided the
right spirit were behind them. The Tyanean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
knew no differences of race or creed; such narrow
limitations were not for the philosopher.</p>

<p>Beyond all others would he have laughed to
hear the word &#8220;miracle&#8221; applied to his doings.
&#8220;Miracle,&#8221; in its Christian theological sense, was
an unknown term in antiquity, and is a vestige
of superstition to-day. For though many believe
that it is possible by means of the soul to effect
a multitude of things beyond the possibilities of
a science which is confined entirely to the
investigation of physical forces, none but the
unthinking believe that there can be any interference
in the working of the laws which Deity
has impressed upon Nature&mdash;the credo of
Miraculists.</p>

<p>Most of the recorded wonder-doings of Apollonius
are cases of prophecy or foreseeing; of
seeing at a distance and seeing the past; of
seeing or hearing in vision; of healing the sick
or curing cases of obsession or possession.</p>

<p>Already as a youth, in the temple at &AElig;g&aelig;,
Apollonius gave signs of the possession of the
rudiments of this psychic insight; not only did
he sense correctly the nature of the dark past of
a rich but unworthy suppliant who desired the
restoration of his eyesight, but he foretold,
though unclearly, the evil end of one who made
an attempt upon his innocence (i. 12).</p>

<p>On meeting with Damis, his future faithful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
henchman volunteered his services for the long
journey to India on the ground that he knew
the languages of several of the countries through
which they had to pass. &#8220;But I understand
them all, though I have learned none of them,&#8221;
answered Apollonius, in his usual enigmatical
fashion, and added: &#8220;Marvel not that I know
all the tongues of men, for I know even what
they never say&#8221; (i. 19). And by this he meant
simply that he could read men&#8217;s thoughts, not
that he could speak all languages. But Damis
and Philostratus cannot understand so simple a
fact of psychic experience; they will have it
that he knew not only the language of all men,
but also of birds and beasts (i. 20).</p>

<p>In his conversation with the Babylonian
monarch Vardan, Apollonius distinctly claims
foreknowledge. He says that he is a physician
of the soul and can free the king from the
diseases of the mind, not only because he knows
what ought to be done, that is to say the proper
discipline taught in the Pythagorean and similar
schools, but also because he foreknows the nature
of the king (i. 32). Indeed we are told that the
subject of foreknowledge (&#960;&#961;&#959;&#947;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;), of which
science (&#963;&#959;&#966;&#8055;&#945;) Apollonius was a deep student,
was one of the principal topics discussed by our
philosopher and his Indian hosts (iii. 42).</p>

<p>In fact, as Apollonius tells his philosophical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
and studious friend the Roman Consul Telesinus,
for him wisdom was a kind of divinizing or
making divine of the whole nature, a sort of
perpetual state of inspiration (&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#8057;&#962;) (iv. 40).
And so we are told that Apollonius was apprised
of all things of this nature by the energy of his
d&aelig;monial nature (&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;o&#957;&#8055;&#969;&#962;) (vii. 10). Now for
the student of the Pythagorean and Platonic
schools the &#8220;d&aelig;mon&#8221; of a man was what may
be called the higher self, the spiritual side of the
soul as distinguished from the purely human.
It is the better part of the man, and when his
physical consciousness is at-oned with this
&#8220;dweller in heaven,&#8221; he has (according to the
highest mystic philosophy of ancient Greece)
while still on earth the powers of those incorporeal
intermediate beings between Gods and
men called &#8220;d&aelig;mons&#8221;; a stage higher still, the
living man becomes at-oned with his divine soul,
he becomes a God on earth; and yet a stage
higher he becomes at one with the Good and so
becomes God.</p>

<p>Hence we find Apollonius indignantly rejecting
the accusation of magic ignorantly brought
against him, an art which achieved its results by
means of compacts with those low entities with
which the outermost realm of inner Nature
swarms. Our philosopher repudiated equally
the idea of his being a soothsayer or diviner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
With such arts he would have nothing to do;
if ever he uttered anything which savoured of
foreknowledge, let them know it was not by
divination in the vulgar sense, but owing to
&#8220;that wisdom which God reveals to the wise&#8221;
(iv. 44).</p>

<p>The most numerous wonder-doings ascribed to
Apollonius are instances precisely of such foreknowledge
or prophecy.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> It must be confessed
that the utterances recorded are often obscure
and enigmatical, but this is the usual case with
such prophecy; for future events are most
frequently either seen in symbolic representations,
the meaning of which is not clear until
after the event, or heard in equally enigmatical
sentences. At times, however, we have instances
of very precise foreknowledge, such as the refusal
of Apollonius to go on board a vessel
which foundered on the voyage (v. 18).</p>

<p>The instances of seeing present events at a
distance, however&mdash;such as the burning of a
temple at Rome, which Apollonius saw while at
Alexandria&mdash;are clear enough. Indeed, if people
know nothing else of the Tyanean, they have at
least heard how he saw at Ephesus the assassination
of Domitian at Rome at the very moment
of its occurrence.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>
<p>It was mid-day, to quote from the graphic
account of Philostratus, and Apollonius was in one
of the small parks or groves in the suburbs, engaged
in delivering an address on some absorbing
topic of philosophy. &#8220;At first he sank his voice
as though in some apprehension; he, however,
continued his exposition, but haltingly, and with
far less force than usual, as a man who had some
other subject in his mind than that on which he
is speaking; finally he ceased speaking altogether
as though he could not find his words. Then
staring fixedly on the ground, he started forward
three or four paces, crying out: &#8216;Strike the
tyrant; strike!&#8217; And this, not like a man who
sees an image in a mirror, but as one with the
actual scene before his eyes, as though he were
himself taking part in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning to his astonished audience he told
them what he had seen. But though they hoped
it were true, they refused to believe it, and
thought that Apollonius had taken leave of his
senses. But the philosopher gently answered:
You, on your part, are right to suspend your
rejoicings till the news is brought you in the
usual fashion; &#8220;as for me, I go to return thanks
to the Gods for what I have myself seen&#8221; (viii.
26).</p>

<p>Little wonder, then, if we read, not only of a
number of symbolic dreams, but of their proper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
interpretation, one of the most important
branches of the esoteric discipline of the school.
(See especially i. 23 and iv. 34.) Nor are we
surprised to hear that Apollonius, relying entirely
on his inner knowledge, was instrumental in
obtaining the reprieve of an innocent man at
Alexandria, who was on the point of being
executed with a batch of criminals (v. 24).
Indeed, he seems to have known the secret past
of many with whom he came in contact (vi. 3, 5).</p>

<p>The possession of such powers can put but
little strain on the belief of a generation like our
own, to which such facts of psychic science are becoming
with every day more familiar. Nor should
instances of curing disease by mesmeric processes
astonish us, or even the so-called &#8220;casting out of
evil spirits,&#8221; if we give credence to the Gospel narrative
and are familiar with the general history of
the times in which such healing of possession and
obsession was a commonplace. This, however,
does not condemn us to any endorsement of the
fantastic descriptions of such happenings in which
Philostratus indulges. If it be credible that
Apollonius was successful in dealing with obscure
mental cases&mdash;cases of obsession and possession&mdash;with
which our hospitals and asylums are filled
to-day, and which are for the most part beyond
the skill of official science owing to its ignorance
of the real agencies at work, it is equally evident<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
that Damis and Philostratus had little understanding
of the matter, and have given full rein
to their imagination in their narratives. (See ii.
4; iv. 20, 25; v. 42; vi. 27, 43.) Perhaps,
however, Philostratus in some instances is only
repeating popular legend, the best case of which
is the curing of the plague at Ephesus which
the Tyanean had foretold on so many occasions.
Popular legend would have it that the cause of
the plague was traced to an old beggar man,
who was buried under a heap of stones by the
infuriated populace. On Apollonius ordering
the stones to be removed, it was found that
what had been a beggar man was now a mad
dog foaming at the mouth (iv. 10)!</p>

<p>On the contrary, the account of Apollonius&#8217;
&#8220;restoring to life&#8221; a young girl of noble birth
at Rome, is told with great moderation. Our
philosopher seems to have met the funeral
procession by chance; whereupon he suddenly
went up to the bier, and, after making some
passes over the maiden, and saying some inaudible
words, &#8220;waked her out of her seeming
death.&#8221; But, says Damis, &#8220;whether Apollonius
noticed that the spark of the soul was still alive
which her friends had failed to perceive&mdash;they
say it was raining lightly and a slight vapour
showed on her face&mdash;or whether he made the
life in her warm again and so restored her,&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
neither himself nor any who were present could
say (iv. 45).</p>

<p>Of a distinctly more phenomenal nature are
the stories of Apollonius causing the writing to
disappear from the tablets of one of his accusers
before Tigellinus (iv. 44); of his drawing his leg
out of the fetters to show Damis that he was not
really a prisoner though chained in the dungeons
of Domitian (vii. 38); and of his &#8220;disappearing&#8221;
(&#7968;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#8055;&#963;&#952;&#951;) from the tribunal (viii. 5).<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>We are not, however, to suppose that
Apollonius despised or neglected the study of
physical phenomena in his devotion to the inner
science of things. On the contrary, we have
several instances of his rejection of mythology
in favour of a physical explanation of natural
phenomena. Such, for instance, are his explanations
of the volcanic activity of &AElig;tna (v. 14, 17),
and of a tidal wave in Crete, the latter being
accompanied with a correct indication of the
more immediate result of the occurrence. In
fact an island had been thrown up far out to sea
by a submarine disturbance as was subsequently
ascertained (iv. 34). The explanation of the
tides at Cadiz may also be placed in the same
category (v. 2).</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section XIII.</span></h4>

<h3>HIS MODE OF LIFE.</h3>

<p>We will now present the reader with some
general indications of the mode of life of
Apollonius, and the manner of his teaching, of
which already something has been said under
the heading &#8220;Early Life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our philosopher was an enthusiastic follower
of the Pythagorean discipline; nay, Philostratus
would have us believe that he made more superhuman
efforts to reach wisdom than even the
great Samian (i. 2). The outer forms of this
discipline as exemplified in Pythagoras are thus
summed up by our author.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naught would he wear that came from a
dead beast, nor touch a morsel of a thing that
once had life, nor offer it in sacrifice; not for
him to stain with blood the altars; but honey-cakes
and incense, and the service of his song
went upward from the man unto the Gods, for
well he knew that they would take such gifts
far rather than the oxen in their hundreds with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
the knife. For he, in sooth, held converse with
the Gods and learned from them how they were
pleased with men and how displeased, and thence
as well he drew his nature-lore. As for the rest,
he said, they guessed at the divine, and held
opinions on the Gods which proved each other
false; but unto him Apollo&#8217;s self did come,
confessed, without disguise,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> and there did come
as well, though unconfessed, Athena and the
Muses, and other Gods whose forms and names
mankind did not yet know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hence his disciples regarded Pythagoras as an
inspired teacher, and received his rules as laws.
&#8220;In particular did they keep the rule of silence
regarding the divine science. For they heard
within them many divine and unspeakable things
on which it would have been difficult for them
to keep silence, had they not first learned that it
was just this silence which spoke to them&#8221; (i. 1).</p>

<p>Such was the general declaration of the nature
of the Pythagorean discipline by its disciples.
But, says Apollonius in his address to the
Gymnosophists, Pythagoras was not the inventor
of it. It was the immemorial wisdom, and
Pythagoras himself had learnt it from the
Indians.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> This wisdom, he continued, had
spoken to him in his youth; she had said:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;For sense, young sir, I have no charms; my
cup is filled with toils unto the brim. Would
anyone embrace my way of life, he must resolve
to banish from his board all food that once bore
life, to lose the memory of wine, and thus no
more to wisdom&#8217;s cup befoul&mdash;the cup that doth
consist of wine-untainted souls. Nor shall wool
warm him, nor aught that&#8217;s made from any
beast. I give my servants shoes of bast and
as they can to sleep. And if I find them overcome
with love&#8217;s delights, I&#8217;ve ready pits down
into which that justice which doth follow hard
on wisdom&#8217;s foot, doth drag and thrust them;
indeed, so stern am I to those who choose my
way, that e&#8217;en upon their tongues I bind a chain.
Now hear from me what things thou&#8217;lt gain, if
thou endure. An innate sense of fitness and of
right, and ne&#8217;er to feel that any&#8217;s lot is better
than thy own; tyrants to strike with fear
instead of being a fearsome slave to tyranny; to
have the Gods more greatly bless thy scanty gifts
than those who pour before them blood of bulls.
If thou art pure, I&#8217;ll give thee how to know what
things will be as well, and fill thy eyes so full
of light, that thou may&#8217;st recognise the Gods, the
heroes know, and prove and try the shadowy
forms that feign the shapes of men&#8221; (vi. 11).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>
<p>The whole life of Apollonius shows that he
tried to carry out consistently this rule of life,
and the repeated statements that he would never
join in the blood-sacrifices of the popular cults
(see especially i. 24, 31; iv. 11; v. 25), but
openly condemned them, show not only that the
Pythagorean school had ever set the example of
the higher way of purer offerings, but that they
were not only not condemned and persecuted as
heretics on this account, but were rather regarded
as being of peculiar sanctity, and as following a
life superior to that of ordinary mortals.</p>

<p>The refraining from the flesh of animals, however,
was not simply based upon ideas of purity,
it found additional sanction in the positive love
of the lower kingdoms and the horror of inflicting
pain on any living creature. Thus Apollonius
bluntly refused to take any part in the chase,
when invited to do so by his royal host at
Babylon. &#8220;Sire,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;have you
forgotten that even when you sacrifice I will
not be present? Much less then would I do
these beasts to death, and all the more when
their spirit is broken and they are penned in
contrary to their nature&#8221; (i. 38).<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p>But though Apollonius was an unflinching
task-master unto himself, he did not wish to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>impose his mode of life on others, even on his
personal friends and companions (provided of
course they did not adopt it of their own free
will). Thus he tells Damis that he has no wish
to prohibit him from eating flesh and drinking
wine, he simply demands the right of refraining
himself and of defending his conduct if called on
to do so (ii. 7). This is an additional indication
that Damis was not a member of the inner circle
of discipline, and the latter fact explains why so
faithful a follower of the person of Apollonius
was nevertheless so much in the dark.</p>

<p>Not only so, but Apollonius even dissuades
the R&#257;j&#257;h Phraotes, his first host in India, who
desired to adopt his strict rule, from doing so,
on the ground that it would estrange him too
much from his subjects (ii. 37).</p>

<p>Three times a day Apollonius prayed and
meditated; at daybreak (vi. 10, 18; vii. 31), at
mid-day (vii. 10), and at sun-down (viii. 13).
This seems to have been his invariable custom;
no matter where he was he seems to have
devoted at least a few moments to silent meditation
at these times. The object of his worship
is always said to have been the &#8220;Sun,&#8221; that is to
say the Lord of our world and its sister worlds,
whose glorious symbol is the orb of day.</p>

<p>We have already seen in the short sketch
devoted to his &#8220;Early Life&#8221; how he divided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
the day and portioned out his time among his
different classes of hearers and inquirers. His
style of teaching and speaking was the opposite
of that of a rhetorician or professional orator.
There was no art in his sentences, no striving
after effect, no affectation. But he spoke &#8220;as
from a tripod,&#8221; with such words as &#8220;I know,&#8221;
&#8220;Methinks,&#8221; &#8220;Why do ye,&#8221; &#8220;Ye should know.&#8221;
His sentences were short and compact, and his
words carried conviction with them and fitted
the facts. His task, he declared, was no longer
to seek and to question as he had done in his
youth, but to teach what he knew (i. 17). He
did not use the dialectic of the Socratic school,
but would have his hearers turn from all else
and give ear to the inner voice of philosophy
alone (iv. 2). He drew his illustrations from
any chance occurrence or homely happening (iv.
3; vi. 3, 38), and pressed all into service for
the improvement of his listeners.</p>

<p>When put on his trial, he would make no
preparation for his defence. He had lived his
life as it came from day to day, prepared for
death, and would continue to do so (viii. 30).
Moreover it was now his deliberate choice to
challenge death in the cause of philosophy.
And so to his old friend&#8217;s repeated solicitations
to prepare his defence, he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Damis, you seem to lose your wits in face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
of death, though you have been so long with
me and I have loved philosophy e&#8217;en from my
youth;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> I thought that you were both yourself
prepared for death and knew full well my generalship
in this. For just as warriors in the field
have need not only of good courage but also of
that generalship which tells them when to fight,
so too must they who wisdom love make careful
study of good times to die, that they may choose
the best and not be done to death all unprepared.
That I have chosen best and picked the moment
which suits wisdom best to give death battle&mdash;if
so it be that any one should wish to slay me&mdash;I&#8217;ve
proved to other friends when you were by,
nor ever ceased to teach you it alone&#8221; (vii. 31).</p>

<p>The above are some few indications of how
our philosopher lived, in fear of nothing but
disloyalty to his high ideal. We will now make
mention of some of his more personal traits, and
of some of the names of his followers.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section XIV.</span></h4>

<h3>HIMSELF AND HIS CIRCLE.</h3>

<p>Apollonius is said to have been very beautiful
to look upon (i. 7, 12; iv. 1);<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> but beyond this
we have no very definite description of his
person. His manner was ever mild and gentle
(i. 36; ii. 22) and modest (iv. 31; viii. 15),
and in this, says Damis, he was more like an
Indian than a Greek (iii. 36); yet occasionally
he burst out indignantly against some special
enormity (iv. 30). His mood was often pensive
(i. 34), and when not speaking he would remain
for long plunged in deep thought, during which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>his eyes were steadfastly fixed on the ground
(i. 10 et al.).</p>

<p>Though, as we have seen, he was inflexibly
stern with himself, he was ever ready to make
excuses for others; if, on the one hand, he
praised the courage of those few who remained
with him at Rome, on the other he refused to
blame for their cowardice the many who had
fled (iv. 38). Nor was his gentleness shown
simply by abstention from blame, he was ever
active in positive deeds of compassion (cf. vi. 39).</p>

<p>One of his little peculiarities was a liking to
be addressed as &#8220;Tyanean&#8221; (vii. 38), but why
this was so we are not told. It can hardly have
been that Apollonius was particularly proud of
his birth-place, for even though he was a great
lover of Greece, so that at times you would call
him an enthusiastic patriot, his love for other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>countries was quite as pronounced. Apollonius
was a citizen of the world, if there has ever been
one, into whose speech the word native-land did
not enter, and a priest of universal religion in
whose vocabulary the word sect did not exist.</p>

<p>In spite of his extremely ascetic life he was a
man of strong physique, so that even when he
had reached the ripe age of four-score years, we
are told, he was sound and healthy in every limb
and organ, upright and perfectly formed. There
was also a certain indefinite charm about him
that made him more pleasant to look upon than
even the freshness of youth, and this even though
his face was furrowed with wrinkles, just as the
statues in the temple at Tyana represented him
in the time of Philostratus. In fact, says his
rhetorical biographer, report sang higher praises
over the charm of Apollonius in his old age than
over the beauty of Alcibiades in his youth (viii.
29).</p>

<p>In brief, our philosopher seems to have been
of a most charming presence and lovable disposition;
nor was his absolute devotion to philosophy
of the nature of the hermit ideal, for he passed
his life among men. What wonder then that he
attracted to himself many followers and disciples!
It would have been interesting if Philostratus
had told us more about these &#8220;Apollonians,&#8221;
as they were called (viii. 21), and whether they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
constituted a distinct school, or whether they
were grouped together in communities on the
Pythagorean model, or whether they were simply
independent students attracted to the most commanding
personality of the times in the domain
of philosophy. It is, however, certain that many
of them wore the same dress as himself and
followed his mode of life (iv. 39). Repeated
mention is also made of their accompanying
Apollonius on his travels (iv. 47; v. 21; viii. 19,
21, 24), sometimes as many as ten of them at
the same time, but none of them were allowed to
address others until they had fulfilled the vow
of silence (v. 43).</p>

<p>The most distinguished of his followers were
Musonius, who was considered the greatest
philosopher of the time after the Tyanean, and
who was the special victim of Nero&#8217;s tyranny
(iv. 44; v. 19; vii. 16), and Demetrius, &#8220;who
loved Apollonius&#8221; (iv. 25, 42; v. 19; vi. 31;
vii. 10; viii. 10). These names are well known
to history; of names otherwise unknown are the
Egyptian Dioscorides, who was left behind owing
to weak health on the long journey to Ethiopia
(iv. 11, 38; v. 43), Menippus, whom he had
freed from an obsession (iv. 25, 38; v. 43),
Ph&aelig;dimus (iv. 11), and Nilus, who joined him
from Gymnosophists (v. 10 <i>sqq.</i>, 28), and of
course Damis, who would have us think that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
was always with him from the time of their
meeting at Ninus.</p>

<p>On the whole we are inclined to think that
Apollonius did not establish any fresh organisation;
he made use of those already existing, and
his disciples were those who were attracted to him
personally by an overmastering affection which
could only be satisfied by being continually
near him. This much seems certain, that he
trained no one to carry on his task; he came
and went, helping and illuminating, but he
handed on no tradition of a definite line, and
founded no school to be continued by successors.
Even to his ever faithful companion, when bidding
him farewell for what he knew would be the
last time for Damis on earth, he had no word to
say about the work to which he had devoted
his life, but which Damis had never understood.
His last words were for Damis alone, for the
man who had loved him, but who had never
known him. It was a promise to come to him
if he needed help. &#8220;Damis, whenever you
think on high matters in solitary meditation,
you shall see me&#8221; (viii. 28).</p>

<p>We will next turn our attention to a consideration
of some of the sayings ascribed to Apollonius
and the speeches put into his mouth by
Philostratus. The shorter sayings are in all
probability authentically traditional, but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
speeches are for the most part manifestly the
artistic working-up of the rough notes of Damis.
In fact, they are definitely declared to be so;
but they are none the less interesting on this
account, and for two reasons.</p>

<p>In the first place, they honestly avow their
nature, and make no claim of inspiration; they
are confessedly human documents which endeavour
to give a literary dress to the traditional
body of thought and endeavour which the
life of the philosopher built into the minds of
his hearers. The method was common to antiquity,
and the ancient compilers of certain other
series of famous documents would have been
struck with amazement had they been able to
see how posterity would divinise their efforts
and regard them as immediately inspired by
the source of all wisdom.</p>

<p>In the second place, although we are not to
suppose that we are reading the actual words
of Apollonius, we are nevertheless conscious of
being in immediate contact with the inner
atmosphere of the best religious thought of the
Greek mind, and have before our eyes the picture
of a mystic and spiritual fermentation which
leavened all strata of society in the first century
of our era.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section XV.</span></h4>

<h3>FROM HIS SAYINGS AND SERMONS.</h3>

<p>Apollonius believed in prayer, but how differently
from the vulgar. For him the idea
that the Gods could be swayed from the path of
rigid justice by the entreaties of men, was a
blasphemy; that the Gods could be made
parties to our selfish hopes and fears was to our
philosopher unthinkable. One thing alone he
knew, that the Gods were the ministers of right
and the rigid dispensers of just desert. The
common belief, which has persisted to our own
day, that God can be swayed from His purpose,
that compacts could be made with Him or with
His ministers, was entirely abhorrent to Apollonius.
Beings with whom such pacts could be
made, who could be swayed and turned, were
not Gods but less than men. And so we find
Apollonius as a youth conversing with one of
the priests of &AElig;sculapius as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Since then the Gods know all things, I
think that one who enters the temple with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
right conscience within him should pray thus:
&#8216;Give me, ye Gods, what is my due!&#8217;&#8221; (i. 11).</p>

<p>And thus again on his long journey to India
he prayed at Babylon: &#8220;God of the sun, send
thou me o&#8217;er the earth so far as e&#8217;er &#8217;tis good
for Thee and me; and may I come to know
the good, and never know the bad nor they
know me&#8221; (i. 31).</p>

<p>One of his most general prayers, Damis tells
us, was to this effect: &#8220;Grant me, ye Gods,
to have little and need naught&#8221; (i. 34).</p>

<p>&#8220;When you enter the temples, for what do
you pray?&#8221; asked the Pontifex Maximus
Telesinus of our philosopher. &#8220;I pray,&#8221; said
Apollonius, &#8220;that righteousness may rule, the
laws remain unbroken, the wise be poor and
others rich, but honestly&#8221; (iv. 40).</p>

<p>The belief of the philosopher in the grand ideal
of having nothing and yet possessing all things,
is exemplified by his reply to the officer who
asked him how he dared enter the dominions
of Babylon without permission. &#8220;The whole
earth,&#8221; said Apollonius, &#8220;is mine; and it is
given me to journey through it&#8221; (i. 21).</p>

<p>There are many instances of sums of money
being offered to Apollonius for his services, but
he invariably refused them; not only so but
his followers also refused all presents. On the
occasion when King Vardan, with true Oriental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
generosity, offered them gifts, they turned away;
whereupon Apollonius said: &#8220;You see, my
hands, though many, are all like each other.&#8221;
And when the king asked Apollonius what
present he would bring him back from India,
our philosopher replied: &#8220;A gift that will
please you, sire. For if my stay there should
make me wiser, I shall come back to you better
than I am&#8221; (i. 41).</p>

<p>When they were crossing the great mountains
into India a conversation is said to have taken
place between Apollonius and Damis, which
presents us with a good instance of how our
philosopher ever used the incidents of the day
to inculcate the higher lessons of life. The
question was concerning the &#8220;below&#8221; and
&#8220;above.&#8221; Yesterday, said Damis, we were <i>below</i>
in the valley; to-day we are <i>above</i>, high on the
mountains, not far distant from heaven. So
this is what you mean by &#8220;below&#8221; and &#8220;above,&#8221;
said Apollonius gently. Why, of course, impatiently
retorted Damis, if I am in my right
mind; what need of such useless questions?
And have you acquired a greater knowledge of
the divine nature by being nearer heaven on
the tops of the mountains? continued his
master. Do you think that those who observe
the heaven from the mountain heights are any
nearer the understanding of things? Truth to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
tell, replied Damis, somewhat crestfallen, I <i>did</i>
think I should come down wiser, for I&#8217;ve been
up a higher mountain than any of them, but I
fear I know no more than before I ascended it.
Nor do other men, replied Apollonius; &#8220;such
observations make them see the heavens more
blue, the stars more large, and the sun rise
from the night, things known to those who
tend the sheep and goats; but how God doth
take thought for human kind, and how He doth
find pleasure in their service, and what is virtue,
righteousness, and common-sense, that neither
Athos will reveal to those who scale his summit
nor yet Olympus who stirs the poet&#8217;s wonder,
unless it be the soul perceive them; for should
the soul when pure and unalloyed essay such
heights, I swear to thee, she wings her flight far
far beyond this lofty Caucasus&#8221; (ii. 6).</p>

<p>So again, when at Thermopyl&aelig; his followers
were disputing as to which was the highest
ground in Greece, Mt. &OElig;ta being then in view.
They happened to be just at the foot of the hill on
which the Spartans fell overwhelmed with arrows.
Climbing to the top of it Apollonius cried out:
&#8220;And I think <i>this</i> the highest ground, for those
who fell here for freedom&#8217;s sake have made it
high as &OElig;ta and raised it far above a thousand
of Olympuses&#8221; (iv. 23).</p>

<p>Another instance of how Apollonius turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
chance happenings to good account is the
following. Once at Ephesus, in one of the
covered walks near the city, he was speaking of
sharing our goods with others, and how we ought
mutually to help one another. It chanced that
a number of sparrows were sitting on a tree hard
by in perfect silence. Suddenly another sparrow
flew up and began chirping, as though it wanted
to tell the others something. Whereupon the
little fellows all set to a-chirping also, and flew
away after the new-comer. Apollonius&#8217; superstitious
audience were greatly struck by this
conduct of the sparrows, and thought it was an
augury of some important matter. But the
philosopher continued with his sermon. The
sparrow, he said, has invited his friends to a
banquet. A boy slipped down in a lane hard by
and spilt some corn he was carrying in a bowl;
he picked up most of it and went away. The
little sparrow, chancing on the scattered grains,
immediately flew off to invite his friends to the
feast.</p>

<p>Thereon most of the crowd went off at a run
to see if it were true, and when they came back
shouting and all agog with wonderment, the
philosopher continued: &#8220;Ye see what care the
sparrows take of one another, and how happy
they are to share with all their goods. And yet
we men do not approve; nay, if we see a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
sharing his goods with other men, we call it
wastefulness, extravagance, and by such names,
and dub the men to whom he gives a share,
fawners and parasites. What then is left to us
except to shut us up at home like fattening
birds, and gorge our bellies in the dark until we
burst with fat?&#8221; (iv. 3).</p>

<p>On another occasion, at Smyrna, Apollonius,
seeing a ship getting under weigh, used the
occasion for teaching the people the lesson of
co-operation. &#8220;Behold the vessel&#8217;s crew!&#8221; he
said. &#8220;How some have manned the boats, some
raise the anchors up and make them fast, some
set the sails to catch the wind, how others yet
again look out at bow and stern. But if a single
man should fail to do a single one of these his
duties, or bungle in his seamanship, their sailing
will be bad, and they will have the storm among
them. But if they strive in rivalry each with
the other, their only strife being that no man
shall seem worse than his mates, fair havens
shall there be for such a ship, and all good
weather and fair voyage crowd in upon it&#8221;
(iv. 9).</p>

<p>Again, on another occasion, at Rhodes, Damis
asked him if he thought anything greater than
the famous Colossus. &#8220;I do,&#8221; replied Apollonius;
&#8220;the man who walks in wisdom&#8217;s guileless
paths that give us health&#8221; (v. 21).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
There is also a number of instances of witty
or sarcastic answers reported of our philosopher,
and indeed, in spite of his generally grave mood,
he not unfrequently rallied his hearers, and
sometimes, if we may say so, chaffed the foolishness
out of them (see especially iv. 30).</p>

<p>Even in times of great danger this characteristic
shows itself. A good instance is his answer
to the dangerous question of Tigellinus, &#8220;What
think you of Nero?&#8221; &#8220;I think better of him
than you do,&#8221; retorted Apollonius, &#8220;for you
think he ought to sing, and I think he ought to
keep silence&#8221; (iv. 44).</p>

<p>So again his reproof to a young Cr&#339;sus of the
period is as witty as it is wise. &#8220;Young sir,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;methinks it is not you who own your
house, but your house you&#8221; (v. 22).</p>

<p>Of the same style also is his answer to a
glutton who boasted of his gluttony. He copied
Hercules, he said, who was as famous for the
food he ate as for his labours.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Apollonius, &#8220;for he was Hercules.
But <i>you</i>, what virtue have you, midden-heap?
Your only claim to notice is your chance of being
burst&#8221; (iv. 23).</p>

<p>But to turn to more serious occasions. In
answer to Vespasian&#8217;s earnest prayer, &#8220;Teach me
what should a good king do,&#8221; Apollonius is said
to have replied somewhat in the following words:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
&#8220;You ask me what can not be taught. For
kingship is the greatest thing within a mortal&#8217;s
reach; it is not taught. Yet will I tell you what
if you will do, you will do well. Count not that
wealth which is stored up&mdash;in what is this
superior to the sand haphazard heaped? nor
that which comes from men who groan beneath
taxation&#8217;s heavy weight&mdash;for gold that comes
from tears is base and black. You&#8217;ll use wealth
best of any king, if you supply the needs of
those in want and make their wealth secure for
those with many goods. Be fearful of the power
to do whate&#8217;er you please, so will you use it with
more prudence. Do not lop off the ears of corn
that show beyond the rest and raise their heads&mdash;for
Aristotle is not just in this<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>&mdash;but rather
weed their disaffection out like tares from corn,
and show yourself a fear to stirrers up of strife
not in &#8216;I punish you&#8217; but in &#8216;I <i>will</i> do so.&#8217;
Submit yourself to law, O prince, for you will
make the laws with greater wisdom if you do
not despise the law yourself. Pay reverence
more than ever to the Gods; great are the gifts
you have received from them, and for great
things you pray.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> In what concerns the state
act as a king; in what concerns yourself, act as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>a private man&#8221; (v. 36). And so on much in the
same strain, all good advice and showing a deep
knowledge of human affairs. And if we are to
suppose that this is merely a rhetorical exercise
of Philostratus and not based on the substance
of what Apollonius said, then we must have a
higher opinion of the rhetorician than the rest
of his writings warrant.</p>

<p>There is an exceedingly interesting Socratic
dialogue between Thespesion, the abbot of the
Gymnosophist community, and Apollonius on
the comparative merits of the Greek and
Egyptian ways of representing the Gods. It
runs somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Are we to think,&#8221; said Thespesion,
&#8220;that the Pheidiases and Praxiteleses went up
to heaven and took impressions of the forms of
the Gods, and so made an art of them, or was it
something else that set them a-modelling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, something else,&#8221; said Apollonius, &#8220;something
pregnant with wisdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that? Surely you cannot say it
was anything else but imitation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Imagination wrought them&mdash;a workman
wiser far than imitation; for imitation only
makes what it has seen, whereas imagination
makes what it has never seen, conceiving it with
reference to the thing it really is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Imagination, says Apollonius, is one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
most potent faculties, for it enables us to reach
nearer to realities. It is generally supposed
that Greek sculpture was merely a glorification
of physical beauty, in itself quite unspiritual.
It was an idealisation of form and features, limbs
and muscles, an empty glorification of the
physical with nothing of course really corresponding
to it in the nature of things. But
Apollonius declared it brings us nearer to the
real, as Pythagoras and Plato declared before
him, and as all the wiser teach. He meant this
literally, not vaguely and fantastically. He
asserted that the types and ideas of things are
the only realities. He meant that between the
imperfection of the earth and the highest divine
type of all things, were grades of increasing
perfection. He meant that within each man
was a form of perfection, though of course not
yet absolutely perfect. That the angel in man,
his d&aelig;mon, was of God-like beauty, the summation
of all the finest features he had ever worn
in his many lives on earth. The Gods, too, belonged
to the world of types, of models, of perfections,
the heaven-world. The Greek sculptors
had succeeded in getting in contact with this
world, and the faculty they used was imagination.</p>

<p>This idealisation of form was a worthy way
to represent the Gods; but, says Apollonius, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
you set up a hawk or owl or dog in your temples,
to represent Hermes or Athena or Apollo, you
may dignify the animals, but you make the Gods
lose dignity.</p>

<p>To this Thespesion replies that the Egyptians
dare not give any precise form to the Gods;
they give them merely symbols to which an
occult meaning is attached.</p>

<p>Yes, answers Apollonius, but the danger is
that the common people worship these symbols
and get unbeautiful ideas of the Gods. The
best thing would be to have no representations
at all. For the mind of the worshipper can
form and fashion for himself an image of the
object of his worship better than any art.</p>

<p>Quite so, retorted Thespesion, and then added
mischievously: There was an old Athenian, by-the-by&mdash;no
fool&mdash;called Socrates, who swore by
the dog and goose as though they were Gods.</p>

<p>Yes, replied Apollonius, he was no fool. He
swore by them not as being Gods, but in order
that he might not swear by the Gods (iv. 19).</p>

<p>This is a pleasant passage of wit, of Egyptian
against Greek, but all such set arguments must
be set down to the rhetorical exercises of
Philostratus rather than to Apollonius, who
taught as &#8220;one having authority,&#8221; as &#8220;from a
tripod.&#8221; Apollonius, a priest of universal religion,
might have pointed out the good side and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
bad side of both Greek and Egyptian religious
art, and certainly taught the higher way of
symbolless worship, but he would not champion
one popular cult against another. In the above
speech there is a distinct prejudice against Egypt
and a glorification of Greece, and this occurs in a
very marked fashion in several other speeches.
Philostratus was a champion of Greece against
all comers; but Apollonius, we believe, was wiser
than his biographer.</p>

<p>In spite of the artificial literary dress that is
given to the longer discourses of Apollonius, they
contain many noble thoughts, as we may see
from the following quotations from the conversations
of our philosopher with his friend
Demetrius, who was endeavouring to dissuade
him from braving Domitian at Rome.</p>

<p>The law, said Apollonius, obliges us to die for
liberty, and nature ordains that we should die
for our parents, our friends, or our children.
All men are bound by these duties. But a
higher duty is laid upon the sage; he must die
for his principles and the truth he holds dearer
than life. It is not the law that lays this choice
upon him, it is not nature; it is the strength and
courage of his own soul. Though fire or sword
threaten him, it will not overcome his resolution
or force from him the slightest falsehood; but he
will guard the secrets of others&#8217; lives and all that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
has been entrusted to his honour as religiously
as the secrets of initiation. And I know more
than other men, for I know that of all that I
know, I know some things for the good, some
for the wise, some for myself, some for the Gods,
but naught for tyrants.</p>

<p>Again, I think that a wise man does nothing
alone or by himself; no thought of his so secret
but that he has himself as witness to it. And
whether the famous saying &#8220;know thyself&#8221; be
from Apollo or from some sage who learnt to
know himself and proclaimed it as a good for all,
I think the wise man who knows himself and
has his own spirit in constant comradeship, to
fight at his right hand, will neither cringe at
what the vulgar fear, nor dare to do what most
men do without the slightest shame (vii. 15).</p>

<p>In the above we have the true philosopher&#8217;s
contempt for death, and also the calm knowledge
of the initiate, of the comforter and adviser of
others to whom the secrets of their lives have
been confessed, that no tortures can ever unseal
his lips. Here, too, we have the full knowledge
of what consciousness is, of the impossibility of
hiding the smallest trace of evil in the inner
world; and also the dazzling brilliancy of a
higher ethic which makes the habitual conduct of
the crowd appear surprising&mdash;the &#8220;that which
they do&mdash;not with shame.&#8221;</p>

<h3>FROM HIS LETTERS.</h3>

<p>Apollonius seems to have written many letters
to emperors, kings, philosophers, communities
and states, although he was by no means a
&#8220;voluminous correspondent&#8221;; in fact, the style
of his short notes is exceedingly concise, and
they were composed, as Philostratus says, &#8220;after
the manner of the Laced&aelig;monian scytale&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> (iv.
27 and vii. 35).</p>

<p>It is evident that Philostratus had access to
letters attributed to Apollonius, for he quotes a
number of them,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> and there seems no reason to
doubt their authenticity. Whence he obtained
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>them he does not inform us, unless it be that
they were the collection made by Hadrian at
Antium (viii. 20).</p>

<p>That the reader may be able to judge of the
style of Apollonius we append one or two specimens
of these letters, or rather notes, for they
are too short to deserve the title of epistles.
Here is one to the magistrates of Sparta:</p>

<p>&#8220;Apollonius to the Ephors, greeting!</p>

<p>&#8220;It is possible for men not to make mistakes,
but it requires noble men to acknowledge they
have made them.&#8221;</p>

<p>All of which Apollonius gets into just half as
many words in Greek. Here, again, is an interchange
of notes between the two greatest philosophers
of the time, both of whom suffered imprisonment
and were in constant danger of death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apollonius to Musonius, the philosopher,
greeting!</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to go to you, to share speech and
roof with you, to be of some service to you. If
you still believe that Hercules once rescued
Theseus from Hades, write what you would have.
Farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Musonius to Apollonius, the philosopher,
greeting!</p>

<p>&#8220;Good merit shall be stored for you for
your good thoughts; what is in store for me is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
one who waits his trial and proves his innocence.
Farewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Apollonius to Musonius, greeting!</p>

<p>&#8220;Socrates refused to be got out of prison by
his friends and went before the judges. He was
put to death. Farewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Musonius to Apollonius, the philosopher,
greeting!</p>

<p>&#8220;Socrates was put to death because he made
no preparation for his defence. I shall do so.
Farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>However, Musonius, the Stoic, was sent to
penal servitude by Nero.</p>

<p>Here is a note to the Cynic Demetrius,
another of our philosopher&#8217;s most devoted friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apollonius, the philosopher, to Demetrius,
the Dog,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> greeting!</p>

<p>&#8220;I give thee to Titus, the emperor, to teach
him the way of kingship, and do you in turn give
me to speak him true; and be to him all things
but anger. Farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>In addition to the notes quoted in the text of
Philostratus, there is a collection of ninety-five
letters, mostly brief notes, the text of which is
printed in most editions.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> Nearly all the critics
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>are of opinion that they are not genuine, but
Jowett<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> and others think that some of them may
very well be genuine.</p>

<p>Here is a specimen or two of these letters.
Writing to Euphrates, his great enemy, that is
to say the champion of pure rationalistic ethic
against the science of sacred things, he says:</p>

<p>17. &#8220;The Persians call those who have the
divine faculty (or are god-like) Magi. A Magus,
then, is one who is a minister of the Gods, or
one who has by nature the god-like faculty. You
are no Magus but reject the Gods (i.e., are an
atheist).&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, in a letter addressed to Criton, we
read:</p>

<p>23. &#8220;Pythagoras said that the most divine
art was that of healing. And if the healing art
is most divine, it must occupy itself with the
soul as well as with the body; for no creature
can be sound so long as the higher part in it is
sickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Writing to the priests of Delphi against the
practice of blood-sacrifice, he says:</p>

<p>27. &#8220;Heraclitus was a sage, but even he<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>
never advised the people of Ephesus to wash out
mud with mud.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p><p>Again, to some who claimed to be his
followers, those &#8220;who think themselves wise,&#8221; he
writes the reproof:</p>

<p>43. &#8220;If any say he is my disciple, then let
him add he keeps himself apart out of the Baths,
he slays no living thing, eats of no flesh, is free
from envy, malice, hatred, calumny, and hostile
feelings, but has his name inscribed among the
race of those who&#8217;ve won their freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among these letters is found one of some
length addressed to Valerius, probably P.
Valerius Asiaticus, consul in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 70. It is a
wise letter of philosophic consolation to enable
Valerius to bear the loss of his son, and runs as
follows:<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>&#8220;There is no death of anyone, but only in
appearance, even as there is no birth of any, save
only in seeming. The change from being to becoming
seems to be birth, and the change from
becoming to being seems to be death, but in
reality no one is ever born, nor does one ever die.
It is simply a being visible and then invisible;
the former through the density of matter, and
the latter because of the subtlety of being&mdash;being
which is ever the same, its only change being
motion and rest. For being has this necessary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>peculiarity, that its change is brought about by
nothing external to itself; but whole becomes
parts and parts become whole in the oneness of
the all. And if it be asked: What is this which
sometimes is seen and sometimes not seen, now
in the same, now in the different?&mdash;it might be
answered: It is the way of everything here in the
world below that when it is filled out with matter
it is visible, owing to the resistance of its density,
but is invisible, owing to its subtlety, when it is
rid of matter, though matter still surround it and
flow through it in that immensity of space which
hems it in but knows no birth or death.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why has this false notion [of birth and
death] remained so long without a refutation?
Some think that what has happened through
them, they have themselves brought about.
They are ignorant that the individual is brought
to birth <i>through</i> parents, not by parents, just as
a thing produced <i>through</i> the earth is not
produced <i>from</i> it. The change which comes to
the individual is nothing that is caused by his
visible surroundings, but rather a change in the
one thing which is in every individual.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what other name can we give to it but
primal being? &#8217;Tis it alone that acts and suffers
becoming all for all through all, eternal deity,
deprived and wronged of its own self by names
and forms. But this is a less serious thing than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
that a man should be bewailed, when he has
passed from man to God by change of state and
not by the destruction of his nature. The fact
is that so far from mourning death you ought to
honour it and reverence it. The best and fittest
way for you to honour death is now to leave
the one who&#8217;s gone to God, and set to work to
play the ruler over those left in your charge as
you were wont to do. It would be a disgrace
for such a man as you to owe your cure to time
and not to reason, for time makes even common
people cease from grief. The greatest thing is a
strong rule, and of the greatest rulers he is best
who first can rule himself. And how is it
permissible to wish to change what has been
brought to pass by will of God? If there&#8217;s a
law in things, and there <i>is</i> one, and it is God who
has appointed it, the righteous man will have no
wish to try to change good things, for such a wish
is selfishness, and counter to the law, but he will
think that all that comes to pass is a good thing.
On! heal yourself, give justice to the wretched
and console them; so shall you dry your tears.
You should not set your private woes above
your public cares, but rather set your public
cares before your private woes. And see as well
what consolation you already have! The nation
sorrows with you for your son. Make some
return to those who weep with you; and this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
you will more quickly do if you will cease from
tears than if you still persist. Have you not
friends? Why! you have yet another son.
Have you not even still the one that&#8217;s gone?
You have!&mdash;will answer anyone who really
thinks. For &#8216;that which is&#8217; doth cease not&mdash;nay
<i>is</i> just for the very fact that it will be for
aye; or else the &#8216;is not&#8217; is, and how could that
be when the &#8216;is&#8217; doth never cease to be?</p>

<p>&#8220;Again it will be said you fail in piety to God
and are unjust. &#8217;Tis true. You fail in piety
to God, you fail in justice to your boy; nay more,
you fail in piety to him as well. Would&#8217;st know
what death is? Then make me dead and send
me off to company with death, and if you will
not change the dress you&#8217;ve put on it,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> you will
have straightway made me better than yourself.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section XVII.</span></h4>

<h3>THE WRITINGS OF APOLLONIUS.</h3>

<p>But besides these letters Apollonius also wrote
a number of treatises, of which, however, only
one or two fragments have been preserved.
These treatises are as follows:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The Mystic Rites or Concerning Sacrifices.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>
This treatise is mentioned by Philostratus
(iii. 41; iv. 19), who tells us that it set
down the proper method of sacrifice to every
God, the proper hours of prayer and offering.
It was in wide circulation, and Philostratus had
come across copies of it in many temples and
cities, and in the libraries of philosophers.
Several fragments of it have been preserved,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>
the most important of which is to be found in
Eusebius,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> and is to this effect: &#8220;&#8217;Tis best to
make no sacrifice to God at all, no lighting of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>a fire, no calling Him by any name that men
employ for things of sense. For God is over all,
the first; and only after Him do come the other
Gods. For He doth stand in need of naught e&#8217;en
from the Gods, much less from us small men&mdash;naught
that the earth brings forth, nor any life
she nurseth, or even any thing the stainless air
contains. The only fitting sacrifice to God is
man&#8217;s best reason, and not the word<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> that
comes from out his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;We men should ask the best of beings through
the best thing in us, for what is good&mdash;I mean
by means of mind, for mind needs no material
things to make its prayer. So then, to God,
the mighty One, who&#8217;s over all, no sacrifice
should ever be lit up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noack<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> tells us that scholarship is convinced
of the genuineness of this fragment. This book,
as we have seen, was widely circulated and held
in the highest respect, and it said that its rules
were engraved on brazen pillars at Byzantium.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p><i>b.</i> The Oracles or Concerning Divination, 4
books. Philostratus (iii. 41) seems to think that
the full title was Divination of the Stars, and
says that it was based on what Apollonius had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>learned in India; but the <i>kind</i> of divination
Apollonius wrote about was not the ordinary
astrology, but something which Philostratus
considers superior to ordinary human art in
such matters. He had, however, never heard of
anyone possessing a copy of this rare work.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The Life of Pythagoras. Porphyry refers
to this work,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> and Iamblichus quotes a long
passage from it.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p><i>d.</i> The Will of Apollonius, to which reference
has already been made, in treating of the sources
of Philostratus (i. 3). This was written in the
Ionic dialect, and contained a summary of his
doctrines.</p>

<p>A Hymn to Memory is also ascribed to him,
and Eudocia speaks of many other (&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7940;&#955;&#955;&#945; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#8049;) works.</p>

<p>We have now indicated for the reader all the
information which exists concerning our philosopher.
Was Apollonius, then, a rogue, a
trickster, a charlatan, a fanatic, a misguided
enthusiast, or a philosopher, a reformer, a conscious
worker, a true initiate, one of the earth&#8217;s
great ones? This each must decide for himself,
according to his knowledge or his ignorance.</p>

<p>I for my part bless his memory, and would
gladly learn from him, as now he is.</p>

(Gotha; 1866), a work of marvellous bibliographical
industry, refers to three supposed portraits of Apollonius
(p. 621). (i) In the Campidoglio Museum of the Vatican,
Indicazione delle Sculture (Roma; 1840), p. 68, nos. 75, 76,
77; (ii) in the Mus&eacute;e Royal Bourbon, described by Michel
B. (Naples; 1837), p. 79, no. 363; (iii) a contorniate
reproduced by Visconti. I cannot trace his first reference,
but in a Guide pour le Mus&eacute;e Royal Bourbon, traduit par
C. J. J. (Naples; 1831), I find on p. 152 that no. 363 is a
bust of Apollonius, 2&frac34; feet high, carefully executed, with a
Zeus-like head, having a beard and long hair descending
onto the shoulders, bound with a deep fillet. The bust
seems to be ancient. I have, however, not been able to
find a reproduction of it. Visconti (E. Q.) in the atlas of
his Iconographie Grecque (Paris; 1808), vol. i. plate 17, facing
p. 68, gives the reproduction of a contorniate, or medal with
a circular border, on one side of which is a head of Apollonius
and the Latin legend APOLLONIVS TEANEVS. This also
represents our philosopher with a beard and long hair; the
head is crowned, and the upper part of the body covered with
a tunic and the philosopher&#8217;s cloak. The medal, however, is
of very inferior workmanship, and the portrait is by no
means pleasing. Visconti in his letterpress devotes an angry
and contemptuous paragraph to Apollonius, &#8220;ce trop c&eacute;l&egrave;bre
imposteur,&#8221; as he calls him, based on De Tillemont.</p></div>

<h3><b>THE PISTIS SOPHIA: A Gnostic Gospel.</b></h3>

<p class="indent">(With Extracts from the Books of the Saviour appended).
Originally translated from Greek into Coptic, and now
for the first time Englished from Schwartze&#8217;s Latin
Version of the only known Coptic MS., and checked by
Am&eacute;lineau&#8217;s French Version. With an Introduction and
Bibliography. 394 pp., large octavo. Cloth, 7s. 6d. net.</p>

<h4><i>SOME PRESS OPINIONS.</i></h4>

<p class="small">&#8220;The Pistis Sophia has long been recognised as one of the
most important Gnostic documents we possess, and Mr Mead
deserves the gratitude of students of Church History and of the
History of Christian Thought, for his admirable translation and
edition of this curious Gospel.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Mr Mead has done a service to other than Theosophists by
his translation of the Pistis Sophia. This curious work has not
till lately received the attention which it deserves....
He has prefixed a short Introduction, which includes an excellent
bibliography. Thus, the English reader is now in a position to
judge for himself of the scientific value of the only Gnostic
treatise of any considerable length which has come down to us.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;From a scholar&#8217;s point of view the work is of value as
illustrating the philosophico-mystical tendencies of the second
century.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Record.</i></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Mr Mead deserves thanks for putting in an English dress
this curious document from the early ages of Christian philosophy.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Manchester

<h4>SOME PRESS NOTICES.</h4>

<p class="small">&#8220;Mr Mead has done his work in a scholarly and painstaking fashion.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Guardian.</i></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The ordinary student of Christian evidences, if he confines his reading to the &#8216;Fathers,&#8217;
learns nothing of these opinions [the so-called Gnostic &#8216;heresies&#8217;] except by way of refutation
and angry condemnation. In Mr Mead&#8217;s pages, however, they are treated with
impartiality and candour.... These remarks will suffice to show the unique character
of this volume, and to indicate that students may find here matter of great service to the
rational interpretation of Christian thought.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Bradford Observer.</i></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The book, Mr Mead explains, is not intended primarily for the student, but for the
general reader, and it certainly should not be neglected by anyone who is interested in
the history of early Christian thought.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Scotsman.</i></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The work is one of great labour and learning, and deserves study as a sympathetic
estimate of a rather severely-judged class of heretics.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Written in a clear and elegant style.... The bibliographies in the volume are of
world-wide range, and will be most valuable to students of theosophy.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Asiatic Quarterly.</i></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Mr Mead writes with a precision and clearness on subjects usually associated with
bewildering technicalities and mystifications. Even the long-suffering &#8216;general reader&#8217;
could go through this large volume with pleasure. That is a great deal to say of a book
on such a subject.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Light.</i></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;This striking work will certainly be read not only with the greatest interest in the
select circle of the cultured, but by that much larger circle of those longing to learn all
about Truth.... May be summed up as an extraordinary clear exposition of the
Gnosis of Saints and the Sages of philosophic Christianity.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Roman Herald.</i></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Comprehensive, interesting, and scholarly.... The chapters entitled &#8216;Some
Rough Outlines of the Background of the Gnosis&#8217; are well written, and they tend to
focus the philosophic and religious movement of the ancient world. There is a very
excellent bibliography.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Spectator.</i></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Mr Mead does us another piece of service by including a complete copy of the
Gnostic <i>Hymn of the Robe of Glory</i> ... and a handy epitome of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> is
another item for which the student will be grateful.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Literary Guide.</i></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The author has naturally the interest of a theosophist in Gnosticism, and approaches
the subject accordingly from a point of view different from our own. But while his point
of view emerges in the course of the volume, this does not affect the value of his work
for those who do not share his special standpoint.... Mr Mead has at any rate rendered
us an excellent service, and we shall look forward with pleasure to his future studies.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The
Primitive Methodist Quarterly.</i></p>

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
